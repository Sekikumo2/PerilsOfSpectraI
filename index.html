Groggily, you tell it to give you five more minutes.  As the captain, you are afforded certain privileges, after all.

Unfortunately, the chime refuses to cease.  It would appear one of your passengers still remembers their command codes, and has decided the captain has to wake up at a reasonable time.  Revissa, her arms around your waist, her face nuzzled in the crook between your neck and shoulder, makes an annoyed grunt.  You know her well enough to understand that if you don’t make that sound go away soon, there’s going to be a problem.

What do you do?

No damn alarm is going to tell you what to do!  You fold your ears as flat against your head as you can and pull Revissa in closer, determined to cuddle away the morning without interruptions.

Revissa, unfortunately, is not having it.  There is a sudden rush of movement as your wife shapeshifts into a grizzly bear and pounces at the comm panel, destroying it with a combination of teeth and claws and a quarter-ton of raw physical force.  She growls proudly at her handiwork before shifting back to her normal appearance, though, sadly, the display was jarring enough to shake away the last dregs of drowsiness from your body, leaving you with little recourse but to get out of bed and actually do your job.

There will be consequences for this brazen defiance of your authority!  But for the moment, you just want to get more sleep.

Gently removing your arm from your gorgeous wife’s waist, you sleepily flail about on the table next to your bed to find your blaster pistol.  Obviously, firing it within crew quarters would show a blatant disregard for any and all safety regulations.  But wouldn’t it also be unsafe to force the captain to report for duty when she was still drowsy?  

Unfortunately, when you finally get your hands around the blaster, your clumsy fingers accidentally depress the trigger, causing a beam of concentrated energy to emit from the muzzle of the weapon and ricochet wildly around the room (you obviously didn’t leave the safety on - who would have time to disengage it if you were raided by pirates in your sleep and needed to defend yourself in a hurry?)  

In the end, the blast just harmlessly dissipates against the ceiling, but not before somehow triggering the automated fire suppression systems.  Thus you and Revissas are rudely awakened by a dousing of cooling foam, forcing you both out of bed as you shiver wildly.  On the bright side, as soon as your feet touch the floor, the comm system registers you as being awake, and the alarm helpfully stops.

At this point, further attempts to sleep are pointless, leaving you with little recourse but to get out of bed and actually do your job.

And so, with the deepest regret imaginable, you extricate yourself from Revissa’s warm and loving embrace and slide out of bed.

On the bright side, as soon as your feet touch the floor, the comm system registers you as being awake, and the alarm helpfully stops.  On the darker side (though this is open to interpretation), Revissa is none too pleased that you have shirked your responsibility to spend the morning cuddling with her, and immediately shapeshifts into a giant spider.  It only takes her a few seconds to use this form’s natural silk-spinning abilities to render you quite incapable of performing any additional duties.

With the threat properly contained, she transforms back to her normal self and spends the next half hour making the case for why you should never have crawled out of bed.  It is *quite* convincing.

Sadly, all good things must eventually come to an end, and when the alarm blares a second time even she must acquiesce that duty must be performed.  She cuts you free, helps wipe off any sticky residue leftover from her bindings, and permits you to get started with your day.  At least you’re not tired anymore!

Your name is Melfy Murachi.  You’re the captain of the Lucky Break, and the Commander of the Rabbit’s Foot Company, a mercenary outfit you inherited after a run of bad luck took out all the former members.  You’re 5 foot 10 - about average height for a kemomi, with short blonde hair and fur that turns brown at the tips of your ears and tail.  A daily workout regimen ensures a muscular physique, even if in recent years you haven’t had as much occasion to make use of it.  You’d like to think it’s your bright blue eyes and winning smile that makes you irresistible to the ladies, but honestly it’s probably just this rockin&#39; bod.

Though by no means famous, you and your crew made a name for yourself during the war between the Kemomi Empire and the Elvaan Federation.  Some might even generously say your heroics turned the tides - maybe even saved the galaxy!  Not that the details ever became fully public.  Either way, after the war died down, most of your crew went their separate ways.  A lot of the enlisted support crew you were ‘borrowing’ either went back to their old positions in the military or returned to civilian life.  Krysta and Lumina settled down together on Mine Nine, eager to start a family.  And Vhaja made good on a promise to officially begin pursuing a career in the Empire navy.  Despite being an Elvaan, you hear she’s proven herself capable enough that there are whispers she’ll have her own starship command within a year or two!

Which is kind of why you’re out here in the first place.  A week ago, Vhaja got in touch, asking for your help to conduct some field research that has to be kept under wraps for political reasons.  Eager for some action, you readily agreed - even if you still don’t know exactly what the mission entails.

You watch a pair of hands encircle your waist in the reflection on the wall as Revissa slides in against you.  She gently kisses you on the shoulder, moving in such a way that shows off the adorable twitches of the little deer tail poking out from her pert behind.

[[Take a look at your smokin’ hot wife -&gt;P03]]
]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="P03" tags="" position="300,0" size="100,100">You’ve loved many women over the years, but none as completely or as passionately as you&#39;ve Revissa Bloomtender.  You first met her when you were just starting out your adventuring career.  She was a part of the Bolg resistance, trying to repel the Orochebi occupation of their homeworld.  You bumped into her just as some Orochebi soldiers were trying to arrest her.  You’d like to say you valiantly rescued her, but instead you were also immediately captured after trying to step in.  Luckily, the rest of your crew at the time tracked you down and got you both free a day later, so technically it was your actions that led to her escape.

What followed was a steamy love affair, strong enough that you were considering joining the resistance together with her.  But she knew better than to get you tied up into it, and disappeared into the night, vanishing from your life until several years later, when *she* helped save *you* from some kidnappers.  At that point, the occupation was long over, and she was happy to join your mercenary company and rekindle your romance, though she was stationed on a different ship.  After the war when the company mostly disbanded, she stayed on, officially tying the knot with you.

Once she has your attention, she lounges alluringly, showing off her body for you to appreciate.

(set: $picP32 to true)

She’s about the same height as you, though with a less defined physique.  Her long brown hair comes down into a tight braid draped over her back, and her fair skin is covered in beautiful green ritual tattoos that denote her as a mistress of druidic Bolg magic.  That said, half her blood is Elvaan, which is why there are only two tiny horns poking out from her forehead rather than the full antlers most of her people would sport - though she still has the adorable deer-like ears and tail, brown like her hair though spattered with spotty patches of white.

She’s talented in various forms of nature magic, able to make plants grow, manipulate the earth and soil, create healing herbs, and even conjure animals to come to her aid.  Though perhaps her most noteworthy ability is the capacity to shapeshift into animal (or animal hybrid) form, letting her be anything from a bird to a bug to a fish to even a T-rex, when the situation calls for it.  You’ve always been particularly fond of her ‘deer-taur’ form, which allows you to hop on her back and ride her - in more ways than one.

With a smile, you pull her in close and go for a passionate good-morning kiss, one which she readily accepts.]

[[Get dressed and head to the bridge -&gt;P03A]]
]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="P04" tags="" position="425,0" size="100,100">Your ship is called the Lucky Break, a modified cargo vessel with space to fit about twenty crew comfortably, though it&#39;s been ages since you’ve even approached that number.  For years it was in such disrepair that visitors were always worried life support would fail at any time, or that a hatch would blow somewhere and you’d all be thrown into the endless vacuum of space.  After the war, you finally got around to having some of those critical systems repaired, enough that while it’s still a piece of junk, at least everything important works, more or less.

As you and Revissa enter the bridge, you find yourselves greeted by a number of familiar faces.  Vhaja is the first to stand and speak to you.

(if: $bearsmash is true)[“Ah, Captain.  So good of you to finally grace us with your presence.  I’m glad to see that in the years since we’ve worked together, you’ve become the sort of person to destroy a comm panel rather than reporting for duty at a reasonable time.”

“That was me, actually,” Revissa says proudly.  “Your alarm ruined our morning.”

“My deepest apologies,” Vhaja replies, with her usual amount of dry snark.  “Next time I drop a lucrative military contract into your lap, I’ll be sure to not actually hold you to completing it.”](if: $foamed is true)[“Ah, Captain.  So good of you to finally grace us with your presence.  And you only caused a single fire in the process.” 

“Oh, don’t worry,” you say with ironic confidence.  “There wasn’t any fire.  I was just trying to shoot the comm panel making that damn alarm and missed by a few meters.”

“Of course.  I’m so glad after dropping a lucrative military contract right into your lap, you would rather destroy part of your own ship than show up on time to complete it.”](if: $bedwebbed is true)[&quot;Ah, Captain.  So good of you to join us.  I suppose a blaring alarm wasn’t quite enough to convince you to roll out of bed.”

You scratch your head sheepishly.  “Actually… I was really trying to report for duty on time.  I just, uh, got a bit tied up along the way.”

Revissa smirks and pinches your butt playfully.  Your tail gently wags as you think about how much fun it was being all wrapped up by her.

Vhaja, ever the vigilant one, picks up on your body language and groans.  “My apologies.  I thought perhaps dropping a lucrative military contract right into your lap was reason enough for you to put your… libidos on hold for just a day, but I suppose I was overestimating your restraint.”

“Oh, no, she was definitely restrained,” Revissa says snidely.  That gets an eyebrow raise from Vhaja, and an embarrassed blush from yourself.]

You hold up your arms diplomatically.  “Look, let’s just put all that aside, and maybe you can finally tell us what this mission is about?”

Vhaja sighs in the way she always does, looking you over with an expression as if she is having regrets about contracting you in the first place.

She was one of the founding members of the current iteration of your mercenary outfit, the Rabbit’s Foot Company.  Surprisingly fit for her species, her trim figure is accentuated with dark brown skin, piercing green eyes, and light lavender hair tied into a pair of signature braids hanging over her shoulder.  As an Elvaan with a rare case of morals, she betrayed her own race by trading military secrets she had access to for Kemomi Empire citizenship.  And when the war ended, she decided to stay on working for the empire navy.  Currently she is serving as a science officer on a mid-sized starship, but she is quickly climbing the ranks to eventually get her own command.  

“I’ve hired you for the purposes of a… simple research mission,” she says slowly.  “You are to head down to a particular planet and place some data-gathering equipment in predetermined locations.”

You raise a skeptical eyebrow.  “No way you’d call me in for something ‘simple’.  Let me guess - this planet is off limits?  The kind of place an official empire science vessel couldn’t be seen near?”

“You are, as always, savvy in your insights.  Yes.  The planet in question has been designated as restricted by inter-planetary treaty.  And yet… the insights it might provide through study are too fascinating to turn down.  For the specifics, I will defer to my partner to explain better than I can.”

]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="P05" tags="" position="575,0" size="100,100">You can’t deny it.  Your pulse always rises whenever you’re near Vhaja’s romantic partner.  Jyumon Zathura, scion of a well-to-do family in the empire, and recently appointed chairwoman of the Kemomi Science Consulate.  Though she is an expert in all things both academic and arcane, her chief speciality is in ghosts, spirits, and the supernatural - phenomena which she herself classifies as falling under the field of ‘spookology’.

But obviously, the thing that stands out most about her is her appearance.  Perfect curves, a beautiful, bushy tail, and long, luscious reddish-brown hair that is always held up in a high ponytail that swishes whenever she moves.  And unlike you and Revissa, she and Vhaja seem to be able to maintain an aura of professionalism when in each other’s presence.  

“To put it simply, the planet we are heading to is incredibly spooky,” she says.

You scratch your head.  “Okay, I rarely say this, but could you maybe put it a little bit less simply?”

The gorgeous fox makes a polite chuckle.  “Less simply, the planet - currently designated as Spectra I - is a ghost.  By which I mean, it should be dead, and yet is not.  According to cosmological scans, several centuries ago its sun released a radiation wave that destroyed all life in the system - including on Spectra.  Yet, somehow, the planet continued to live regardless.  Everything there is, technically, a ghost, but is carrying on pretending that it isn’t.  To the naked eye, it would look like a perfectly normal planet, capable of supporting life - though currently without any sapient species.  However, check it on the thaumaturgical spectrum and it is positively teeming with ectoplasmic matter.”

You’re not sure you understood the less simple explanation, but you nod your head anyway.

“So… why do you need us?”

“The planet is technically in the neutral zone between Kemomi and Elvaan space.  This system was specifically selected as a buffer because, at the time of the treaty, there were no habitable planets there.  But this ghost planet just… showed up a few months ago.  Appeared out of thin air, as far as we can tell.  And we’d like to have a look at it.”

“Can’t you just send down drones or probes?”

“Impossible.  Because it’s a ghost planet, nothing without a soul can physically interact with it.  So what we need is for you to set up some of these data collection devices in a specific formation about ten miles apart from each other, to triangulate readings.  The data collectors are powered by living insects and complex bio-gel circuits, which should be sufficient to allow them to keep operating.”

“Alright… seems simple enough.  Head down, plant the probes, and leave.  So, why did we bring in her?” you ask, pointing to the other face in the room.

Your old friend smiles and comes in for a hug.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="P06" tags="" position="700,0" size="100,100">You grew up an orphan on a small colony run by the Kemomi military.  And ever since you could walk, Krysta had always been there with you.  Your own last name, Murachi, was the name of the colony, given to you since no one even knew who your parents were.  Krysta used to have that name too, making you practically sisters, until she eventually learned she was a part of the infamous McKendricks clan.

Though she is technically half-kemomi, those genes ended up being recessive, meaning she normally has no fur or tail (though a small bout of unrelated lycanthropy means she occasionally transforms into a squirrel girl).  Her other half is Yearthling, a strange race of physically unassuming women with plain, rounded ears, and no other distinguishing features.  Krysta and her wife, Lumina, a winged Celestial outcast from her society, were together with you and Vhaja the founding members of the current Rabbit’s Foot Company.  Now she works as a Star Scout, part of an organization of magical girls who protect the galaxy.  She is on permanent assignment to Mine Nine, a hollowed-out asteroid made into a space station that orbits a wormhole that connects two distant parts of the galaxy.  An important transit hub, which she does her best to keep safe - a far cry from her early days as a petty thief.

“Bring it in!” she says, wrapping her arms tightly around your waist.  Always much stronger than her, you hug her back, tight enough to make her gasp for breath and frantically tap out.

“It’s great to see you.  Both of you,” you say, glancing over at her beautiful wife.  

Lumina smiles and clasps your hand affectionately.  Long black hair, gorgeously feathered wings, and an impressive bust - it’s not hard to see what Krysta sees in her.  Though her best feature is her nurturing personality.  It’s no surprise she would start a family once the war ended.

“How’s the egg?  Hatched yet?” you ask.  How the two of them ended up being the proud parents of a dragon egg is too complicated a question to get into at the moment.

“We’re still waiting, sadly.  Melyra is egg-sitting for the week while we’re away.” Lumina says.  “Though really, you should come see that for yourself.  You don’t visit nearly enough!”

You raise your hands apologetically.  “Sorry… but you know how it is.  Busy living the adventuring life and all–”

“We haven’t had a job in three months,” Revissa chimes in ‘helpfully’.  

That makes you cough awkwardly.  “Anyway!  What about this job requires your, uh, expertise?”

“Knotties,” Krysta says simply.

“...Knotties?”

“Yup.  Apparently they’ve set up camp and have been scavenging the place for resources.  It would seem that restraints made from ghost matter are really excellent at keeping prisoners, uh, ‘fresh’, if you get my meaning.”

The Knottie race, as you well know, is almost entirely dedicated to the art of bondage.  To them the act of restraint is as natural as breathing.  Through various mystical techniques, they can even submit people to a state of ‘permanent bondage’, where the subject no longer needs to eat or drink, and doesn’t even age.  Normally that technique is only available to incredibly talented martial artists, but if you follow what Krysta is saying, tools made from ghost matter can allow anyone to put people into ‘permanent bondage’.  You can see why they’d want the stuff.

“As something of a bondage expert myself, and being well-trained in their techniques, I’m gonna head down to their camp together with Lumi to do some negotiating.  They’re not bound - heh - by the treaty, so if we could pay them under the table to occasionally send us some samples, that would be great.”

Vhaja steps forward.

“So, to summarize.  You and Revissa will plant the probes, Krysta and Lumina will negotiate, and Jyumon and I will remain on the ship in orbit to monitor your progress.  Is that clear?”

You would object to her acting like she’s the captain - but the money on offer for the job really is quite generous.

Vhaja massages her forehead irritably.  “We obviously need to get to it, first.  It’s in the neutral zone, remember?  A half day’s travel with the Lucky Break’s engine.”

“Oh, in that case, why don’t we reminisce about old times?” Lumina suggests brightly.  “It’s been so long since all of us were together!”

“An excellent idea,” Vhaja says.

You were totally going to suggest that!  That’s what you get for trying to be a good captain.  You resolve to never do it again.

“Hey, is it true you installed a holo-simulator?” Krysta asks.

“Actually, yes,” you say.  “How we got the money for it is actually a really cool story.  I had to –”

“Last one there is a rotten clucker egg!” she says loudly, running at full tilt off the bridge.

“Well, if we are pulling rank, I technically have the authority to commission civilian vessels registered with the Empire whenever I like,” Vhaja says playfully. “But for the moment, I will defer to your orders.”

“How generous of you.  But I’m gonna hold you to that.  Before we get started, why don’t we all take the opportunity to catch up on old times?”

“Oh, that sounds lovely!” Lumina says, clapping her hands excitedly.

“Agreed,” says Vhaja.  “We have at least half a day of travel before we reach the neutral zone, so we have plenty of time for it.”

A chance to relax, and put off doing work until the last possible minute?  Now this is more like it!  You feel like things have gone back to how they were in the old days.

“Hey, is it true you installed a holo-simulator?” Krysta asks.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="P07" tags="" position="850,0" size="100,100">Holo simulators come in a variety of models.  Some are equipped with powerful AI processors that can generate entire movie plots on the fly.  Others are little more than glorified film projectors.  The one on the Lucky Break is somewhere between those two, but leaning much closer to the less-advanced end of that spectrum.

Krysta is the first one inside, and is unsuccessfully fiddling with the controls as you enter.  Unlike Vhaja, she doesn’t remember her command codes from when she was an official crew member.  As everyone else files in, you come up beside her and unlock it.

“What program should we run?” she asks, as she begins scrolling through the options.  It is only at this point that you realize why that’s a problem.  “We’ve got… Spider Queen Bondage Dungeon, Virgian Slave Market… oooh, Knottie Sex Cult!”

You get her in a headlock and drag her away from the controls.  Everyone else laughs as your face turns a bright shade of red.

“The Spider Queen one is her favorite,” Revissa says helpfully.

“We know,” say Vhaja and Lumina in unison.  Have your fetishes always been that obvious?  You cough loudly and scroll to the options at the very bottom - the only two that aren’t just purely porn programs.

All of it, of course, is fake, and given the bargain bin parts the chamber has installed, a lot of it doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.  The bushes, for instance, have patches of oddly yellowed leaves in places, whose pattern is identical to the stains on the wall.  But it’s good enough.

Vhaja raises an eyebrow.  “This is the least pornographic program you could muster?”

“And here I thought I wasn’t going to wind up naked on this mission,” Jyumon says with a beleaguered pout.

Revissa has already doffed her clothing, and slides into the water without a care.  “Don’t be shy!  On Bolg, it’s very traditional to meet old acquaintances in the nude, so you can see for yourselves how your bodies have changed since you were away.”

There is some huffing and puffing, but eventually everyone acquiesces.  And after the first hour, no one much seems to mind.  Holographic resort staff bring out tray after tray of holographic snacks, and despite none of it being ‘real,’ the chamber is still programmed to simulate things such as taste - and the effect of alcohol.

All of it, of course, is fake, and given the bargain bin parts the chamber has installed, a lot of it doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.   The sky, for example, would be perfectly convincing - if not for the various discolored splotches in the same shape as the water stains on the wall.

“Whaddya say?  Up for a match… ‘captain’?”

You raise an eyebrow.  “I may be a bit out of practice, but I’ve still got a leg up on you when it comes to sports.”

“Yeah?  Well we’ll see about that!” says the red-head.  “Wanna make a bet?  Loser has to do whatever the winner tells them to!”

“You’re on,” you say, fully confident in your future victory.

Revissa, perhaps slightly turned on by the alpha wolf behavior, sidles up next to you and presses herself against your arm.  “This is a team game though, isn’t it?  Obviously, I’ll be your partner.”

As she face-plants into the sand, you give Revissa a confident look.  Krysta might be passable at athletics, but Lumina is a hopeless klutz.  You’ve got this one in the bag.

“So, what exactly are we playing for?” Revissa asks.

“Hmm… how about the losing team needs to play maid service for the winners?” Krysta suggests.  “Serve drinks and snacks and stuff for the rest of the time in the program.”

Everyone agrees to those terms.  And so the game begins.

It goes almost exactly like you expected it would.  Krysta is passable at the sport, but you’re strongest, faster, and have kept yourself in better shape than she has.  And while Revissa isn’t the most capable when she isn’t using magic, compared to Lumina it’s like night and day.

Still, everything was in good fun, with laughs and smiles had by all as Krysta scampers back and forth fulfilling people’s orders.  You and Revissa spend the rest of the time sitting beside each other, hand in hand, watching the waves and reminiscing on old times with your friends.

“I was actually hoping you would ask,” she says with her trademark quiet confidence.

Krysta scratches her head.  “Oh… I was kind of expecting that Lumi was going to be my partner.”

“A good choice… if you did not want to maximize your chances of winning,” says the Elvaan.

You raise a finger.  “Hey, so, just a point of order, but this is just a normal game, okay?  No magic allowed or anything.”

“Of course,” says Vhaja.  “I would expect nothing less.”

A shiver runs down your spine.  You had been confident in your choice… but now, you somehow feel like you made a mistake.  And as the game begins, you understand why.  Vhaja had always kept herself fit, of course, but you had never taken her for being particularly athletic.  But when the first ball she returns spikes you directly in the face, you are reminded that a few years can make all the difference in the world.

As the game goes on, Jyumon and Lumina cheer from the sidelines, and the points quickly rack up for both sides - with the advantage going to the other team.  Vhaja proves to be far more adept than you ever could have imagined, and soon the only way you can keep up is by intentionally trying to serve on Krysta’s end of the field and hoping she slips up enough to win.  

She doesn’t.

When the last ball hits the sand, the score is 17 to 21 in Team Krysta’s favor.  You lost.

After the girlfriends charge the field to give the winners a hug, Krysta turns to you with a big smile on her face.

“Now… what should we ask of the losers?”

“Consider this practice for the mission,” Vhaja says, as she slams the trunk shut.  “Any Knotties you encounter on the planet will tie far better knots than this.”

And so, for the next few hours, while the other two couples enjoy the sand and sea, you and Revissa wriggle and squirm.  By the time you finally escape, you’ve nearly reached your destination, and you are forced to get out and discuss the finer details of the mission.

The holo-chamber was fun, but in the end, business has to win out over pleasure.  As the simulated environment fades away, everyone puts their original clothes back on, and congregates in the center of the area.  Vhaja inserts a data chip into the computer to bring up a holographic map of Spectra I, then has it zoom in on a particular continent.

“So, to get straight to the point, we need you to land on the planet and place data probes in three predetermined locations.  The probes will triangulate their detection radius and should be able to create an etheric sensor net that will penetrate to the core of the planet.”

You nod blankly, already somewhat lost.  At least everything is clearly labeled.  With the landing site at the center of the map, it looks like you’ll need to venture through three distinct locales - the ruins of an ancient city, a subterranean cavern, and a section simply labeled the ‘spider forest’.  Why is it every planet seems to have a forest (or jungle, or desert, or mountain) filled with spiders?  You’d like to have a word with the creator of the universe about it.

The mission is otherwise simple enough to understand.  Vhaja drones on and on, but really the gist is to just reach the three locations without being caught by the local wildlife.  Or the environment.  Or the Knotties.  Okay, so maybe it won’t exactly be easy, but you’re confident you can pull it off.

“Something to keep in mind is that everything on the planet is comprised of what Jyumon has dubbed ‘ghost matter’ - elements that technically shouldn’t exist in the physical world but which, nonetheless, are in absolute abundance here.  Such matter interacts with sentient beings in unpredictable ways, but most important for our purposes is the fact that it can preserve living creatures entangled with it indefinitely.”

You nod your head.  “So if we, say, were gobbled up by a giant plant, or were wrapped up in spider webs, or even just got buried under a rockslide, we wouldn’t be in any mortal danger.”

“Exactly.  Though you might not be able to escape, you’ll also not suffer from hunger or thirst, you won’t age - you won’t even need to *breathe*, technically.”

“But if no one manages to find us… then we’d also basically be stuck forever.”

“Of course!  It’s been so long since we’ve played any games like this!” she says, doing some stretches - and losing her balance in the process.  

As she face-plants into the sand, you give Revissa a confident look.  Krysta might be passable at athletics, but Lumina is a hopeless klutz.  You’ve got this one in the bag.

“So, what exactly are we playing for?” Revissa asks.

“Hmm… how about the losing team needs to play maid service for the winners?” Krysta suggests.  “Serve drinks and snacks and stuff for the rest of the time in the program.”

Everyone agrees to those terms.  And so the game begins.

You thought it would be easy.  But there was something you didn’t account for.  Jyumon, in her annoyance, put a minor curse of incompetence on Krysta - one to make her trip, stumble, botch her serves, and overall be just as big of a klutz as Lumina was.  But therein lay the problem.  For as soon as the game starts, the power of two people with a comical level of ineptitude somehow cancels each other out, causing all their pratfalls to somehow, consistently, land the ball on your side of the court.  Before you know it, you’re on the ropes.  Which is when you get stabbed in the back by the woman you trusted most.

“I resign from the team!” Revissa yells, right when Team Krysta is one point away from victory.

“Wait… what?” you say, as Krysta steps on a pointy seashell, yowls in pain, falls over, and somehow in her flailing manages to connect with the ball and send it smacking right into your face.  

And so… against all odds, you’ve lost.  But Revissa’s betrayal stings more than the pain of defeat.

“I… can’t believe I have to do this alone…” you grumble, trying to hide the burning sensation in your cheeks.  You’d rather be paraded around naked than be dressed like… this.

Revissa just grins and raises a hand to order.  

“I’ll take a chestnut tea, extra syrup!” she says brightly.

And so the humiliation begins.  Everyone is so amused by your predicament that you have no time to really enjoy the scenery, forced to run back and forth delivering drinks.  For once in your life, you are actually relieved when it comes time to discuss the finer details of your mission, since it means you can finally take a break.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="P09E" tags="" position="450,400" size="100,100">Vhaja steps forward, a surprisingly competitive look on her face.

“I was actually hoping you would ask,” she says with her trademark quiet confidence.

Krysta scratches her head.  “Oh… I was kind of expecting that Lumi was going to be my partner.”

“A good choice… if you did not want to maximize your chances of winning,” says the Elvaan.

You raise a finger.  “Hey, so, just a point of order, but this is just a normal game, okay?  No magic allowed or anything.”

“Of course,” says Vhaja.  “I would expect nothing less.”

A shiver runs down your spine.  You had been confident in your choice… but now, you somehow feel like you made a mistake.  And as the game begins, you understand why.  Vhaja had always kept herself fit, of course, but you had never taken her for being particularly athletic.  But when the first ball she returns spikes you directly in the face, you are reminded that a few years can make all the difference in the world.

However, as the game goes on, the influence of Jyumon’s curse makes itself apparent.  Krysta keeps missing returns, colliding with her partner, or just plain tripping over her own feet.  It would normally be enough to make the game a cakewalk, but even with her teammate more hindrance than help, Vhaja puts on a good show.  Just… not quite good enough.  Perhaps Jyumon should have thought twice about weaving a curse before knowing who the recipient’s teammate was going to be - but you’re not complaining.

When the last ball hits the sand, the score is 21 to 17 in Team Melfy’s favor.  You won!

After giving your girlfriend a great big victory hug, she turns towards the losers with a surprisingly vicious smile on her face.

“Now then… what to do with these two?”

Vhaja and Krysta back away nervously, but Revissa only smiles as she makes some druidic hand motions which are all too familiar to you.  And then in a flash, she has taken the form of a giant spider.  The rest of the scene basically writes itself.

Once the two of them have been divested of their beachwear, Revissa spins them some silky new duds… though perhaps the outfits are a bit too tight.  Either way, the tethers over their lips prevents them from complaining. Once her work is finished, she leaves it to Jyumon and Lumina to decide the fate of their captive lovers.

As they squirm, you can’t help but be a little jealous. (if: $bedwebbed is true)

There’s just something about spider silk that always gets you going.  Maybe it’s the fact that, no matter how strong you are, and no matter how much you struggle, the webbing will never break.  It’s stronger than steel, after all.  Being totally at the mercy of a woman you love is nice too, of course, and so you wiggle happily as you submit yourself to her care.

What you were not expecting was the surprised squeak from Lumina, as she clumsily slipped into some of the leftover strands while playing with her girlfriend.  And then, somehow, managed to completely restrain herself while trying to get free.]

That, somehow, makes it hotter.  Though at least Revissa is nice enough to eventually squish Krysta against Lumina (who both quite enjoy it), and Vhaja to Jyumon (who also enjoy it… but are annoyed that they do).  

If only you could have this much fun every day.  Wait… you do, because this amazing woman is you wife, and she is only too happy to satisfy your fantasies.  Well… all the ones that are possible to satisfy.  To be honest, even more than your lovely wife, you still dream about being kidnapped for real by a sexy spider lady of some kind, wrapped up tight and forced to submit to all her wildest desires…

Ahem.  Anyway, you still feel pretty fulfilled by the end of this kinky beach party.  Eventually, Revissa cuts you free, and you, in turn, rescue the others.  And though quite a few feathers are ruffled (or in Lumina’s case, gunked up with silk residue), you eventually smooth things over enough that everyone is ready to get back to work discussing the finer details of your mission.

Right now, as you wriggle and squirm, all you can think of is how hot it is that your whole team has been snagged in webbing.  The whole team… except for one.

And so, when Revissa draws near to have some fun with you, you play along… for a time.  But when the opportunity presents itself, you distract her with some heavy moans, then start guiding her to step backwards into some stray silken strands to get herself stuck.  Not enough to really incapacitate her… but she can see the devious gleam in your eyes.  And, bless her heart, she’s always willing to indulge you.  

So she conjures some more webbing with her own nature magic, and starts to wiggle herself into it, spinning this way and that until her arms are stuck at her side and her lips are firmly sealed.

And while you do, the ship moves forward, heading towards your destination.  Since it was a restricted area, you were supposed to turn on some jamming devices to prevent patrol ships from noticing your approach.  But with everyone wrapped up, that never happens.

Eventually, one such ship detects you.  And, when no one responds to the hails they send, the Kemomi officers on the patrol ship naturally board your vessel, and find all of you helplessly writhing in the holo-chamber.  While there’s no harm done, the incident does get entered into the patrol ship’s log… which in turn directly places all of you, and your ship, at the scene, right outside restricted space.

In the end, this forces Vhaja to abort the mission.  Your horniness has completely ruined all their plans, failing the job before you even stepped foot on the planet!  At the very least, you get points for efficiency.  Though now all your friends are mad at you. Suffice to say, Vhaja won’t be approaching you for any more secret missions in the future.

Though the holo-chamber can generate food and drink, and even simulate things such as taste and texture, in the end none of it is ‘real’, and by the time you exit any sense of fullness from eating or any side effects of what you consumed will be gone.  Which means… you could all drink as much as you want with no ill effects afterwards.

So why not a drinking challenge?  You’ll square off and see who can take the most alcohol.  Losers are determined when the holo-chamber’s internal safeties kick in and decide the drink is making them sick - at which point the loser will be disqualified via a paralysis field being activated around their bodies.  What the winners want to do with them while they’re frozen is totally up to them.

Discussion breaks out over the finer points of the rules, but eventually everyone agrees to it in the spirit of good fun.  It is decided the game will be held in two rounds - first everyone pairs off to out-drink a single opponent, and then the remaining three players will have a free-for-all to be the last woman standing.  As the person who suggested the challenge, you take it upon yourself to choose who your first rival will be…

“Trying to rise through the ranks in the empire military means spending a lot of time in back rooms sharing drinks with the brass,” she explains, walking up to your inert form.  And to your surprise, she runs a finger over your body, teasing your sensitive skin.  You would shiver, if you could move a muscle.  “So I’ve built up something of a tolerance… and also learned to be more forward.  Forceful, even.  Kemomi respond better to confidence than quiet logic, I have found.”

And then with a slight smile, she leans in and gives you a soft kiss on your glossy cheek, before pulling away to face the remaining challengers… though she stumbles ever-so-slightly, indicating she has nearly reached her limit herself.

Well, you might have lost, but at least you learned something new about your friend.  And now you, Lumina, and Jyumon get to watch as the remaining girls pick a winner.

Across from you is Jyumon, who frowns in annoyance at the matchup, probably having hoped to have been paired with Vhaja.

None of you can move an inch, able to do nothing but stare ahead and ponder the mistakes that led to this outcome.  Since the drunkenness you’re experiencing is simulated, none of you will sober up naturally, which also means there is no way to automatically trigger the safety protocols to release you.  All you can do is stand and wait, light gleaming off your glossy skin.

And while you do, the ship moves forward, heading towards your destination.  Since it was a restricted area, you were supposed to turn on some jamming devices to prevent patrol ships from noticing your approach.  But with everyone paralyzed, that never happens.

Eventually, one such ship detects you.  And, when no one responds to the hails, the Kemomi officers on the patrol ship naturally board your vessel, and find all of you helplessly trapped in the holo-chamber.  And while there’s no harm done, the incident does get entered into the patrol ship’s log… which in turn directly places all of you, and your ship, at the scene, right outside restricted space.

In the end, this forces Vhaja to abort the mission.  Your crew’s carelessness has completely ruined all their plans, failing the job before you even stepped foot on the planet!  At the very least, you get points for efficiency.

“What a shame… I thought I had finally surpassed you,” she says, quietly setting down her final cup.

You raise an eyebrow.  “I didn’t realize you were trying to.”

Vhaja smiles warmly.  “To be honest… I had always looked up to you, Melfy.  Your confidence.  Self-assurance.  Even when you were hopelessly outmatched, when you were woefully unqualified to handle the situation.  Over your head.”

“Um… I think I’m supposed to be flattered?” you murmur.  Is she being serious right now?  Or is it just the sake talking?

The Elvaan answers that all on her home.  With strangely eager eyes, she leans forward, kissing you deeply on the lips.

“Trying to rise through the ranks in the empire military means spending a lot of time in back rooms sharing drinks with the brass,” she explains, slowly drawing away.  “So I’ve built up something of a tolerance… and also learned to be more forward.  Forceful, even.  Kemomi respond better to confidence than quiet logic, I have found.”

“I don’t… wha?” you sputter.  “You and Jyumon are still together, aren’t you?”

“We are.  And I love her completely.  It was actually she who picked up on it… my lingering emotions.  My attraction to you - both emotional and physical.  We have an agreement, the two of us, that permits us to seek out pleasure in other arms, when the inclination takes us.  I originally had no plans on pursuing it with you, of course… but I suppose losing to you has brought all those feelings to the forefront once more.”

And so she stands up, posing herself calmly on the paralysis pad.  It starts to glow, as arresting light washes over her.

“Enjoy your prize… Captain.”]

A deep blush covers your cheeks - and not just from the alcohol.  You had no idea Vhaja had felt this way about you.  Sure, you’d hooked up once, right when she first joined the crew, but that was at a time the two of you were emotionally vulnerable.  That there was still something there…

Well, if she opened up this much, it would be rude of you not to reciprocate.  She said Jyumon was okay with it… and you know Revissa would be too.  And so… you take your prize.  Or maybe it’s her who really won?  Your fingers, your lips - and on a few occasions, your teeth - find purchase on her frozen body.  She is stiff yet still soft and warm, and unresisting to your advances as you pull off, you hope, some of your best moves.  And though there is no outward indication of her pleasure, certain autonomous functions of her body provide you a clue as to her enjoyment.

 And so, for the next two hours, the losers are at your mercy, though only one of them has your attention.  Until, eventually, you instruct the holo-emitters to set everyone free. After all, you weren’t really getting drunk, the program was just making assumptions about the state of your body based on its parameters.  And once those parameters are altered, no one feels inebriated anymore, and the simulator releases everyone from the paralysis fields holding them stiffly in place. 

At which point, it is finally time to get back to work and go over the details of your mission.

“I imagine there are many things about me that would surprise you,” she says calmly.  “While the rest of you have settled for complacency since the war, I have continued to push myself forward.”

“Well prepare to – *hic* – start standing still!” Krysta says, clearly the most inebriated of the three of you.

You honestly can’t believe the slim Elvaan could be so good at packing away alcohol, but as the empty cups pile up, you start to realize that she’s going to win.  It annoys you, because you feel like you had her beat this time - which is when you remember getting doused with fire suppressant earlier in the day.  A chilly awakening is not the best way to start the morning, and it might have taken your edge off in this fight.  Oh well.  With a sigh, you stand up and resign yourself to your fate.]

“Trying to rise through the ranks in the empire military means spending a lot of time in back rooms sharing drinks with the brass,” she explains, walking up to your inert form.  And to your surprise, she runs a finger over your body, teasing your sensitive skin.  You would shiver, if you could move a muscle.  “So I’ve built up something of a tolerance… and also learned to be more forward.  Forceful, even.  Kemomi respond better to confidence than quiet logic, I have found.”

And then with a slight smile, she leans in and gives you a soft kiss on your glossy cheek, before pulling away to give more… intimate attention to her girlfriend.

Well, you might have lost, but at least you learned something new about your friend. 

The losers all spend the next two hours at the whim of the winner, but, eventually, they instruct the holo-emitters to set you free.

And once those parameters are altered, no one feels inebriated anymore, and the simulator releases everyone from the paralysis fields holding them stiffly in place. 

At which point, it is finally time to get back to work and go over the details of your mission.

[[Listen to the details -&gt;P10]]
]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="P11" tags="" position="1125,0" size="100,100">Jyumon steps forward, handing you a series of small capsules.

“These are nano-fiber synthesizers and molecular recombiners.  Able to generate clothing, tools, and basic equipment within seconds.  I’ve already taken the liberty of programming them based on your outfits and weapons compliment.”

You nod your head in thanks.  “That’ll help.  Funny how the perils on alien planets always seem to destroy your clothing, isn’t it?”

“You call it ‘funny’, I call it ‘infuriating’.  I had to go on a mission in a spider-filled jungle once, and got stripped naked more times than I can count.  Which is why I never leave home without at least a few dozen of these, just in case.”

After slipping them into your pocket, Lumina walks up to you next.

“I’ve spent the last few weeks imbuing these stones with Celestial healing magic,” she explains.  “Hold it up to your body and it will cure you of most wounds… and revert any unwanted transformations.”

You nod and accept the handful of beautifully glowing diamonds - every single one sparkles as if a star were trapped within its prism.  These will be useful.  Perhaps the only thing more common than spiders on your adventures are things that want to petrify, gild, vitrify, encase, solidify, harden, congeal, or otherwise immobilize you.

The angel gives you a warm, but worried smile.  “But don’t get too careless - if both of you get transformed at the same time there won’t be anyone around to restore you.  Based on Vhaja’s analysis, it doesn’t look like anything on the planet will be able to petrify you permanently… but that doesn’t do you much good if no one can find your statues…”

“Which is where I come in!” says Krysta.  

She hops forward and hands to you what looks like a small, individually wrapped hard candy.

“This is a Star Scout Tracking Gumdrop,” she explains.  “Cherry flavor, of course.  Once you eat it, you’ll give off a magical aura that is detectable on most Star Scout comm frequencies.  If you feel particularly imperiled, it will basically send out a distress beacon that can be used to track you down for a rescue.”

You palm it quickly.  “Not that I’ll need it, of course.”

“Hey, you never know,” your friend says with a shrug.  “Just make sure you finish the whole thing, or it won’t work.”

Finally, Vhaja approaches you, bearing two small packages wrapped in cloth.

“And these are from me.”

You take one and uncover it, revealing what appears to be a small, rune-covered dagger.

“If you find yourself thoroughly restrained with materials made out of ghost matter, your raw strength probably isn’t going to be much help in getting you free - but this is enchanted to allow you to sever even spectral substances.  Without this, getting captured probably means you’d be staying that way until someone else arrives to rescue you.  So… try not to have both of you get restrained at the same time.”

“No promises,” you say with a smirk.  “Because the only thing hotter than being bound and gagged and at the mercy of a sexy evil lady is having your wife bound up right beside you.”

Vhaja gives Revissa a stern look.  “Please do not indulge her fetishes while on an important mission.”

Your wife snickers and gives you a quick peck on the cheek.  “You have my word - if she tries to surrender herself to a sexy villain, I’ll make sure to tie her up first instead.”

“How… reassuring,” the Elvaan mutters.

But with that, it appears all the details have been thoroughly explained.  And a helpful chime from the ship’s computer tells you that you’re nearing the restricted area of space around the planet.  It looks like it’s time to finally get this mission underway!

[[Head to the bridge -&gt;P12]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="P12" tags="" position="1125,125" size="100,100">As soon as you arrive at the bridge, you instruct the ship’s computer to activate a signal jammer to make sure no nearby ships notice your approach.  The entire reason for bringing you in on this mission is to avoid the diplomatic incident that would arise if a Kemomi ship breached the Neutral Zone, so you don’t wanna anyone to know you’re here - even the local Kemomi patrols.  Once that is done, you bring the Lucky Break out of its hyper-jump, leaving you about twenty minutes of sub-light flight away from your destination.

Vhaja makes a motion for you to draw near.

“Now then, for the most important part of the mission.  Please take these data synthesizers.  They are specially made to gather information from Spectra I.”

A strange device that seems to be comprised of concentric rectangular frames with a brightly colored sphere in the center begins to hover above her hand.

“And they are also one of a kind,” says Jyumon.  “Or at least, three-of-a-kind.  And quite sensitive.&quot; 

(link:&quot;Accept the synthesizer&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

“It has bio-gel circuitry, and is powered by tiny, living insects which inhabit the inner frames.  Each segment has a different scanning function, and must be set up within a triangulated distance from one another, about a mile apart.”

You carefully take the object from her hands and slip it into your bag.

Vhaja looks at you sternly.  “Please do not lose it, drop it, or delay too long in setting it up.  Once properly aligned, the segments will attune to the planet’s thaumic field, but if it runs out of battery before then it will be rendered inert.”

“So basically, if we get incapacitated for too long, the mission’s a bust,” you observe.

“Exactly.  Please distribute the pieces at the proper locations as quickly as possible, and we will perform remote calibrations from orbit on the ship.  However, transmission signals must otherwise be kept to an absolute minimum, both because we are not supposed to be here in the first place, but also because they will impact the synthesizer’s calibration settings.  The only messages you should send are for each time you reach one of the destinations and set up the device to let us know to begin searching for its data stream.  Once you’re finished, rendezvous with Krysta and Lumina at the Knottie camp, then head back to the landing site for extraction.”

You nod in understanding. “Got it.  So, maintain radio silence except after each successful installation.”  

At this point, you feel like you’ve gone over everything you needed to.  You and Revissa just go over your equipment (and maybe do a bit of light canoodling), until you hear Krysta call out from in front of the helm.

“Hey, looks like the planet is coming into view!”
(set: $picP28 to true)

[[Check it out -&gt;P13]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="P13" tags="" position="1125,250" size="100,100">Spectra I looks like - well, a planet.  Green landmasses, blue oceans, a perfectly breathable atmosphere.  Not that different from Fuwafuwa Prime, or any other habitable, life-supporting world.

“So… what’s the big deal?” says Krysta, saying aloud what you were thinking.  “Looks pretty boring to me.”

Jyumon begins fiddling with the viewscreen controls.  “Well, for one thing, the ectoplasmic discharge that builds up in the stratosphere creates a perpetual aurora borealis.  At any time of year, any time of day, in any part of the continent, not localized to any particular region.”

“Can I see it?” Revissa asks.

“Yes, of course.”  

And with a press of a button, a display of the sky above the landing sight sends shivers down your spine as a kaleidoscopic array of fantastic colors swirls in a constant celestial tango.  The display becomes only more vibrant as the ship breaches the planet’s atmosphere, quickly passing through clouds as it descends to the designated landing coordinates.  From this high up, the trek to the three targets doesn’t look like it will be that bad at all, but you know from experience how dicey missions can get in the blink of an eye.

To your relief, the Lucky Break’s landing struts properly deploy without any additional coaxing, despite not having been serviced since before the end of the war.  And they hold their weight as the ship touches ground, giving nothing more than a few protesting creaks as the engines power down.

[[Disembark -&gt;P14]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="P14" tags="" position="1125,400" size="100,100">The Lucky Break’s exit is via the loading ramp in the cargo bay, and, like always, the bay doors get stuck as they try to roll down, forcing you to take time to manually pull the emergency override lever to get it moving.  Someday you’ll get it properly repaired.  Probably.

As soon as the ramp lowers, you are struck by a whiff of some of the freshest air you’ve ever breathed, and a dazzling light show twisting in the sky above you.  To the west is a thriving, verdant forest, to the east are the ruins of long-gone civilization, and south are towering cliffs that nearly reach the aurora.  For a supposedly dead planet, it certainly feels more alive than most industrialized worlds you’ve visited.  Though, when you pay closer attention, you do get a sense of… wrongness to the place.  You can’t really put a finger on why, because nothing your eyes, ears, or even nose tells you seems incorrect, yet the fur on the end of your tail still stands on end.

*Fwump!*

Speaking of fur, your oldest friend suddenly sprouts some as she takes in the view.

You still don’t quite understand the process by which it happened - some kind of ancient magic that ‘unlocks true potential’ or something, but whatever the reason, Krysta now suffers from a ‘curse’ that randomly changes her from Yearthling to Squira.  You always knew she was half Kemomi, but it seems the curse activated her recessive genes - and this was the result.  While poofy-tailed she is faster and more nimble, and is able to scamper up trees and steep inclines, but is also more skittish and excitable, racing away at the slightest provocation.

“Oooh… look at all those high branches!” she yells, eyes darting to the west.  She starts to high-tail it over there, but a chiding voice from above calls her back before she gets too far.]

Though it’s been a few years, Lumina’s heavenly curves haven’t diminished an inch.  If she’s gotten rounder since then, it’s been in all the right places.  Her wings flutter behind her as she takes to the air, catching Krysta by the scruff and pulling her in the proper direction.

“*Our* job is to be diplomats - remember?”

“Right!  Bondage!” Krysta says, her big, poofy tail swaying wildly behind her.  You’re totally not jealous of how much floofier she is than you when she’s like this.  Nope.  Not at all.  

She scampers back towards you and smiles.

“Alright, time for us to head out!  You can find us with all the sexy tentacle-head ladies - just listen for the sound of ropes and leather,” she says with a smirk.

For you, bondage is a fun way to pass the time with a girlfriend (or a sexy villain).  For Krysta - and for Knotties - it’s a way of life.  An art form.  You have every confidence she’ll be able to win them over with her skills.

And then she’s off in the proper direction.  Lumina waves one last time, before soaring after her in the air.  Though, before she gets out of sight, Krysta turns and calls out to you.

“Make sure to eat that candy!” she yells.

Right.  The Star Scout Tracking Gumdrop.  Apparently it’ll send out a distress signal if you get trapped.  You fish around in your pocket, peel off the wrapper, and pop it in your mouth.

…and immediately wish you hadn’t.  It tastes *rancid*.  Does this thing come with an expiration date?  Or did Krysta just let it ferment in pickle juice and fish oil?

You’ve cleared one path, but there will be others once the game is complete.  Here’s a preview of what you can find in the Ancient Ruins.

Spectra I is a dead world, literally.  Centuries ago all life on it was destroyed, yet somehow, the planet still carries on as if it wasn’t.  But while trees and plants and baser animals are still active here, there’s no signs of intelligent life, despite the fact there are ruins of advanced civilizations scattered all across the land.  While exploring this area, you might just solve the mystery of why that is.

But before you enter the deepest part of the ruins, first you’ll need to find the entrance.  That will require moving about on the surface through a network of destroyed buildings.  All those broken walls and collapsed roofs make for perfect hiding places… for you, or for a predator trying to hunt you.

Her name is Iwani, and she’s a gorgon.  And not just any gorgon - a gorgon with whom Melfy is intimately familiar.  Years ago, you foiled her plot to petrify the holo-film star Artura Rembrant and got her arrested.  It turns out Iwani had been spending centuries adopting the persona of film directors just to capture famous actresses right before their careers declined, but you ruined all that and had her gallery of starlets taken from her.  Now she wants revenge.  She’s followed you to this planet and donned hunting gear, and is lying in wait to add you to her collection as payback.

If you manage to make it past her (and unlock the entrance to the ruins with a key you might find in the Knottie Camp), you’ll descend underground to a subterranean crypt.  It’s full of dangerous traps, but also hidden archeological secrets that reveal the hidden history of this dead planet.  And there’s someone here researching those secrets.]

She could be an ally, but push her the wrong way, and she might push *you* into some of the traps throughout the temple to make her own job easier.

    You bring up a map of the area on your comm device, noting that your next destination is a few hours walk from the landing site.
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

With one success already under your belt, you’re feeling pretty good.  Good enough to tackle what is surely the most difficult task of the adventure - making it through a forest full of spiders.  On every planet you visit, there always seems to be something that wants to snag you in webs - be it massive arachnids, adorable moths, or, your favorite, gorgeous ladies with silk-spinning abilities.  And while there is no promise there are actually any spiders in the ‘spider forest’ (and if there are, that any of them are hot-lady-shaped) you certainly walk with a spring in your step as you imagine how much fun it will be if there are.

](else-if: $stagecomplete is &#39;2&#39;)[
    So this is it, the last leg of the adventure.  You just need to plant one more data collection device and you’ll be done.  It’s been a rough time so far, but you’re feeling confident as you bring up the map of the area on your comm device.  Only a few hour’s walk to the outskirts of the forest area.
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

“Saving the best for last, are we?” says Revissa with a knowing smirk.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You raise an eyebrow at her, but she points to your backside - where your tail has been steadily wagging back and forth.  Okay, fine, so it’s true.  You’ve always been turned on by the idea of getting tangled up in webs - especially when it’s a gorgeous lady spinning the silk.  And while there is no guarantee that the ‘spider forest’ has spiders (or that they are lady-shaped spiders if there are), you won’t deny you kind of hope there will be.

](else: )[Your tail flicks behind you eagerly as you bring up the map of the local area on your comm device.  From the landing site, it’s maybe an hour’s walk to reach the edge of the forest area, and then a significantly more difficult trek to get to the location where you need to place the data device.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Revissa rolls her eyes.  “Of course you would want to check out the forest first.  What, is my shapeshifting not enough to indulge your spider obsession?”  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You cough awkwardly, and try to make excuses, but your wagging tail is a dead giveaway.  Fine, so it’s true.  You have a thing specifically for sexy spider ladies wrapping you up.  Is that so wrong?  It’s not like there’s any guarantee that the ‘spider forest’ actually has spiders in it, or, if there are, that the spiders come in hot lady form - though you’d be lying if you said you weren’t hoping they were.

Fetishistic thoughts aside, the walk to the woods is otherwise uneventful.  The aurora gleams brightly overhead, causing your shadows to form gleaming, rainbow-colored silhouettes against the ground as you travel.  For a ghost planet, everything feels incredibly alive, beautifully vibrant, delightfully engaging - maybe even supernaturally so.  You wonder if this world was so breathtaking before it was destroyed, or if its inexplicable resurrection is responsible for all the wonders you’ve witnessed as you’ve explored it.

Either way, the two of you eventually reach the edge of the trees without incident.  The forest stretches endlessly ahead of you, the trees climbing high into the air.  From a distance, you had thought it must be autumn, because all the leaves were brightly colored, but this close you can see that it’s something far more fantastic.  You’re no botanist, but you know enough about nature to be aware that plants feed on sunlight, that chlorophyll in their leaves drinks in solar rays.  But the aurora must be somehow filtering the sunlight, changing its properties, which in turn imbues every leaf on every tree with a glittery sheen that refracts into rainbow prisms in pools of light on the ground.  It is, to be honest, breathtaking.

“I’ve never seen something so beautiful…” says your wife, spellbound, beside you.

You give her a roguish smile.  “Have you never looked in a mirror?”

That gets you an elbow jab between the ribs.  Revissa chides you for thinking any mere mortal could outstrip the beauty of the natural world.  Looks like chivalry is as dead here as the rest of the planet.  Or maybe you just don’t have as much game as you used to - lines like that used to work all the time when you first started dating!

However, a soft smile from your wife gives you some validation, as she holds out a hand.  And once you take it, she leads you into the trees, her eyes bright and eager to experience the wonders of the forest ahead of you.

You wisely decide not to ask her to keep an eye out for gorgeous spider ladies.

You’ve cleared one path, but there will be others once the game is complete.  Here’s a preview of what you can find in the Caverns.

You’ll need to plant your data device in the deepest part of the caverns, but something is lying in wait there, eager to claim some prey.  You may have encountered a portion of this creature while exploring the forest, a living slime symbiote capable of coating its victims in tightly conforming black rubber.

Her name is Desireé, though she prefers if you just call her Desire.  She hungers for body heat, especially heat generated by intelligent beings.  Her body is nearly indestructible, though it is susceptible to cold, and she’s able to emit powerful pheromones that lure her targets into her lusty embrace.  Once she has them in her thrall, she’ll coat them head to toe in elements of her body and stow them away, to keep them as replenishing sources of sustenance.  Melfy has never met her before, but another member of her crew has, and if she discovered the connection, she might try to use our heroine to lure the rest of her friends into her clutches…

No matter how hard you try, if you face Desireé with just the tools you have available, you’ll be sure to fail.  But perhaps there’s something else in the caverns that can aid you in your quest.  Because, as it so happens, these caves happen to be the location of an ancient dragon’s hoard.  Or, more accurately, multiple dragons.

It was called the First Dragon Bank, and it was a rare collaboration between the ancient and powerful lizards.  The idea was, essentially, they would each contribute some of the wealth from their hoards into a combined stockpile, and that money would be used as capital to fund various ventures in the galactic stock market, with dividends to be paid out between all the members.  However, when Spectra I was supposedly destroyed, the hidden hoard was lost.  But now the planet has returned, and all that dragon’s wealth is ripe for the taking!

…though of course it won’t be *easy*.  The bank is guarded, both by devious traps, and by four artificial intelligence-powered holograms, each bearing the memories and personalities of the dragons that joined forces to bring the bank into existence.]

Rahna Draconlev the red dragon is the first.  Some might call her arrogant, though she would tell them it’s only considered arrogance when your status is unearned.  She believes herself superior to non-dragons merely as a circumstance as her birth, and won’t hold that against you – so long as you respect her strength and authority.  She favors valuables such as gemstones and gold, and her traps will likely transform you into material of the same kind.]

Lady Frigga, the white dragon, is the second.  Though some might call her demeanor ‘cold’, the truth is she is an adherent to the ideas of fairness and justice.   Of course, those who act unjustly must be punished… and intruding upon the hoard of a dragon and trying to steal from it would certainly meet that criteria.  Those she deems to be in need of judgment will be met with icy indifference, and will suffer the chilling consequences of their actions.]

Coactore D. Raco, the amethyst  dragon, is the third member of the alliance.  Though dragons are by nature quite reclusive, Coactore could rightly be called a shut-in.  When she exerts influence over the galaxy, she usually does so from the comfort of her personal lair through shell corporations and holo-net avatars, rarely being seen outside her home.  Some have called her the “Nerd Dragon”, a moniker that fits her well, given her tendency to accumulate trading cards and shiny action figures… and her propensity to use magic or her minty-fresh gloss breath to transform people into those collectibles.]

Finally, there is the mind behind the infrastructure that makes the whole bank tick.  Raziel is half blue dragon and half demon, mistress of lightning and wielder of infernal influence.  The currency she most likes to trade in is information, something she hoards with as much fervor as a traditional dragon accumulates gold.  The bank was her idea, a way to leverage wealth, plus her intel about the galactic stock exchange and market movements, to enrich all the members of the alliance.  Her knowledge is what created the holographic representations of her fellow dragons in the first place, and her own avatar resides in the control center as the admin that keeps the bank running.  

Play your cards right, and something in the bank’s vaults may help you complete your mission.  But one wrong move, and you’ll end up as a part of the hoard instead.

You’ve cleared one path, but there will be others once the game is complete.  Here’s a preview of what you can find in the Knottie Camp.

The Knottie Camp will be a smaller section in terms of the others, about the length of one of the roads through the forest.  It would be more accurate to call it an extension of the Ruins path, especially because the key to the deepest part of the ruins is being held somewhere in the camp, and must be found to proceed.

As a species, the Knotties are wholly dedicated to the art of bondage and restraint - to them, being tied up is part of their religion, it’s a strongly held spiritual belief (though some also favor the use of freezium encasement).  But for some sects of Knotties, this is not just a way of life, but a compulsion that overrides all other thoughts and emotions.  Such is the case for the Shackled Sisters, a powerful and dangerous cult who are dedicated to bringing the love of bondage to all species in the galaxy… by force, if necessary.  Their end goal is for every woman, everywhere, to be placed into permanent and inescapable bondage, and the unique properties of Spectra I’s ghost matter will be instrumental in them advancing that cause.

The leader of the camp is a Shackled Sister named Abrahbaba, though everyone here just calls her by her title of Domina.

Both beautiful and incredibly skilled at the art of restraint, one wrong move in her presence will surely end up taking you to a prison cell – or worse.  But she is still a woman guided by intense religious devotion and an abiding sense of honor, so you might be able to escape her clutches if you find a loophole in the restrictive rules of her belief system.

In addition, while exploring the camp you might stumble upon a beautiful captive.  The kind-hearted, innocent, and almost comically naive Elvaan princess, Noctelle Hozma, has been kidnapped by the bondage-obsessed aliens.]

Rescuing her is certainly the right thing to do… but it will surely complicate matters.  She is a princess in both the literal sense, but also in the meta-fictive sense, in that she embodies the qualities of the damsel in distress to an absurd degree.  Having her nearby will invite perils upon our heroes that they might not be able to rescue her (or themselves) from.  Though would being captured together with such a lovely royal damsel really be considered a “Bad” end?

To advance between story chapters, you simply need to click the blue links, which will either reveal new parts of the current passage or take you to the next one.

On occasion, you will have more than one option, giving the story branching paths.  Sometimes, the paths will eventually reconvene, but the game ‘remembers’ the choices you made, which might influence future events.  It is also possible to encounter ‘Bad Ends’, a series of choices which makes the heroines unable to complete their mission.  When you reach Game Over screen, you will either need to retrace your steps with the back arrow (see below), or start the game over to try again.  

When starting your game over, you can begin from certain checkpoints in the story.  This is useful to avoid repeating segments you have already seen, but keep in mind that many branches in the game depend on choices you have made or secrets you have discovered in earlier sections, so jumping right ahead to a checkpoint may lock you out of some secret paths.

If you hover over the upper left portion of your screen, a curly white ‘back’ arrow will appear, taking you back to the previous passage.  If you do this, any progress made, triggers activated, options chosen, etc, will be ‘forgotten’ by the game.  This is important to keep in mind if you are trying to unlock all of the images for the image gallery, available from the main menu.

At the bottom of every page is a link to return to the Main Menu.  However, if you return to the menu, then resume your current game, your &#39;back&#39; arrow will take you back to the menu and not the previous passage within the game.  

There is also a Save Game feature.  When choosing to save your game, information about the game’s current state is stored as a cookie in the browser you are using.  Make sure that cookies are enabled or you will be unable to save your progress.  Your game will automatically load whenever you start it up.  Please note that there is only one save file, though thanks to the checkpoint system it should never be too difficult to backtrack to a story segment you enjoy.  Unfortunately, there is not currently any way to transfer save files between different computers, devices, or browsers.  This means if you change your device you will need to start the game over again.

Starphoria is a universe created by Sekikumo and TheAmberBub, used as a setting for many stories, roleplaying sessions, and tabletop campaigns.  It features a galaxy full of magic, technology, and adventure!

There are hundreds of different species scattered throughout the worlds of Starphoria, many of them strange, grotesque, monstrous, or even non-organic.  However, all humanoid species are purely female in shape and form.  Everyone in Starphoria who isn’t a weird slug creature, a rock monster, a robot, or some other unusual critter is a gorgeous woman.  And on top of that, those gorgeous women always seem to run afoul of kinky perils.  Clothing gets shredded or destroyed at the slightest touch, entire cultures are built around bondage, petrification, or transformation, and most people seem quick to jump into bed with each other without much pretense.  It’s a playground for the strange predilections of its authors, and it doesn’t pretend to be anything else.

While the history and lore of Starphoria is expansive and ever-evolving, for the purposes of this game, knowing about these factions should be enough to get you up to speed.


**The Kemomi Empire**

The Kemomi are animal-eared women with the traits of cats, foxes, and wolves, with centuries of inter-breeding making them essentially a single species (though usually with dominant features of one of the three).  Within the Empire’s sphere of influence are also the bunny-eared Usami, the aquatic Pescans, and the bushy-tailed Squira.  

**The Elvaan Federation**

Long-eared, lithe-bodied Elvaans are graced with lifespans that are measured in centuries, a fact that often leads to them feeling they are superior to other races.  Far from unified, the Federation is a loose coalition among different subraces of the species, which are roughly grouped into the Blanche and Noire.  

Fiercely hierarchical with a powerful class of nobility, the Elvaans were known for enslaving members of other species or transforming them into decorative statues - especially Kemomi.  Tensions over this practice eventually exploded into a bloody, years-long war, which has only recently ended with a tentative truce.

**Knotties**

A relatively minor species of women on the galactic stage, who have tendril-like growths on their heads instead of hair.  Their entire culture is centered around the art of bondage and restraint.  

**Spider Queens**

A race of war-like conquerors, bearing the upper torso of a powerfully built woman, and the lower body of a monstrous spider.  The only reason they aren’t a major galactic power is that queens are fiercely territorial and constantly battle each other for supremacy, limiting their ability to mobilize on a scale that can threaten the major powers - though isolated or remote colonies often prove tempting targets for individual queens.

**Tsunojians**

A species of horned women who were once aggressive and war-like, until they restructured their culture to focus on sports and other non-violent forms of competition.  Known for hosting the galaxy’s most intense and elaborate game shows.

**The Shackled Sisters**

A fanatical cult of Knottie monks who believe the ideal state of existence is to be in permanent, inescapable bondage - and who wish to forcibly ‘convert’ other beings to sharing in that joy.

**Star Scouts**

A galaxy-wide peace-keeping organization of magical girls.  Anyone, from any species can become a Star Scout, so long as they have a pure heart and a desire to do good.

The trees close in around you, concealing the rest of the planet’s scenery from view.  Leaves crunch and crack beneath your feet as you walk, each one letting out little sparks of iridescence as you release whatever energy remains trapped within them after falling from their branches. All around you, you hear the chattering of birds, see the motion of scurrying insects, and can even smell the pollen of blooming flora filling the air around you.

It would be easy to forget you’re here for a reason.  In fact, for a short while, you do.  But eventually you pull out your comm device and bring out a topological map of the area, trying to pick the best way forward.

Though Revissa loves nature, she finds maps of it artificial and uninteresting.  So as you pore over the readout on your device, she wanders off to inspect some local flora.  But you don’t mind - it’s a perfect opportunity to put your wilderness survival skills to the test!  You might have gotten rusty cooped up in a spaceship for most of your adult life, but you’ve still got the in-born talent of a kemomi to fall back on.

After some deliberation, you pick out three viable trails through the woods.  The first is the low road, taking you along the path of a river cutting through a winding ravine.  The second is the high road, taking you in a curved arc alongside the trajectory of the steep cliffs that encircle the western reaches of the forest.  Finally, you could take the middle road, the shortest in distance, but with no discernible landmarks to follow.  You’d basically be wandering blind through the thickest tangle of forest. 

All the options have their benefits and drawbacks, but after considering from every angle, you make your decision.  Revissa really only seems interested in the local plants, so it seems like you’re free to go in whatever direction you want.

In the end, you opt for the high road.  It might be the longest of the three choices, but it’s also, in your opinion, the safest.  Moving along the side of the cliff will give you a vantage point from which you can overlook the entire forest area, allowing you to spot any obvious signs of danger.  Not to mention you can get the lay of the land, and pick out the best route to reach the destination from afar.  Maybe even figure out why this place is called the Spider Forest.

And so you follow the plan.  Heading west, you find a ridge overlooking the area and head across it, always trying to keep to the higher ground.  The forest is still thick here, but now whenever you climb a tree you are treated to an amazing view of not just the entire forest, but also the landscape beyond it.  You can see the landing site, the scattered tents of the Knottie camp, and the sprawl of ancient ruins just past it.  But… still no spiders.

Not that you were hoping for spiders, or anything… but at the same time, you are a bit upset at the lack of truth in advertising.  Who even named it that, anyway?

“Jyumon did,” Revissa informs you when you ask her.  “She had a bad experience with a jungle expedition once, and from then onwards just assumed every forest was a Spider Forest.”

Fair enough.  And in her defense, most forests the galaxy over are teeming with spiders.  This one seems to be the exception.  Noting your annoyance, Revissa wanders off into the trees for a moment, searching for something.  After a while, she calls you over.

“There you go!” she says proudly.  “Spiders!  In the forest!”

You follow her finger… and sure enough, there is, indeed, a whole nest of tiny arachnids scurrying about in a dead, hollowed-out tree.  Each one is about the size of your fingernail.  They’re covered in bright pink fuzz, and seem to have a whole little society built here, more like a colony of ants than anything else.  Adorable, to be sure, but nothing sexy about it.  Where are the gorgeous spider babes here to wrap you up?!

Revissa just rolls her eyes, even though you didn’t say that out loud.  You grin sheepishly and motion to a log a few meters away.  Good place to take a rest.  She agrees, and the two of you sit down and set down your gear.

(if: $lewdpollen is true)[And then… you take off more than that.  A strange warmth suddenly grips you, and you find yourself peeling off your boots.  And your pants.  Your shirt, your underwear.  What’s happening? Why are you suddenly so… horny?

“The pollen from earlier,” Revissa remarks between heavy breaths.  “From that flower you disturbed.  It must have had… aphrodisiac properties…”

Her face flushes as she reaches over and takes your hand. The two of you lock eyes, expressions of desire evident on both of your faces.  Triggering that pollen was a mistake to be sure, but… you see no reason whatsoever why you shouldn’t capitalize on that mistake right now.]

After careful consideration, you decide on taking the low road.  According to your map, simply following the river’s path will eventually take you a mere half-mile from the destination point, minimizing your chances of getting lost or distracted.  

And so you head to the side of the river.  From one bank to the other it is maybe 30 feet across, though looking over the edge you can see that it gets reasonably deep in places, deep enough that you couldn’t just wade across it.  Thankfully, it is flowing at a pretty manageable pace, though sadly your location is upstream from the direction of the current, so you won’t just be able to sail your way there.

Either way, you make quite good progress following the river’s meandering trail, deciding to stick to the bank instead of venturing off into the trees.  Revissa remarks at all the fascinating plants springing up in the mineral-rich silt at the sides of the stream, happily collecting leaf and seed samples from the ones she finds most interesting and stowing them in her pack.  It is, altogether, a rather uneventful journey, though after about an hour of walking you come across something that surprises you.

Poking out of a tree is a metal spigot, standing out like a sore thumb in the otherwise pristine environment unmarred by the intervention of civilization.  The faucet at the end of the spigot is dripping with the residue of a clear amber liquid, which has piled up in a small puddle at the ground beneath it.  An overwhelming sweet, honey-like scent wafts from the liquid, suggesting it’s some kind of tree nectar rich in natural sugars.  But what’s it doing here, and who’s collecting it?

“I can’t believe it!” Revissa remarks.  “This forest is so beautiful!  Who would dare spoil it by harvesting its resources?”

That is actually an excellent question.  Looking around, you do see a path leading through the trees that looks like it was worn down not by local wildlife, but humanoid feet.  Has someone made an outpost here?  It bears investigating… but poking around could be dangerous if the culprits were smugglers of some sort - not to mention you’d be taking time away from your mission objectives.

(if: $lewdpollen is true)[And yet, as you ponder the choice, you can’t help but take notice of your wife.  The defiant look in her eyes, the slight curl of annoyance on her lips, the adorable way her little deer tail flicks to the side when she’s upset at something.  She’s always the most beautiful when she’s mad.  

You can’t help yourself but feel massively turned on.  In fact, your body is completely gripped by a warmth that defies explanation, and as soon as you register the desire it becomes impossible to ignore, demanding that you act on your impulses immediately.

At the end of the day, you’re just here to plant the data device and leave.  So the direct route seems the best option for the job.  Sure, it’s a thick, impenetrable tangle of trees and foliage, but you’re not some primeval hunter fighting her way through an ancient forest.  You come from a galaxy-spanning civilization with access to tech that would be inconceivable to your distant ancestors.  Technology like a wrist-mounted comm device that can access the scanners back on the Lucky Break in orbit to display a holographic map of the topography.

How could you possibly get lost with something like that?

…an hour of walking later, you find out.  You were so certain you were heading the right way, yet every time you check the map, it displays your position as farther and farther off course.  

“Maybe it’s busted,” Revissa suggests after a while.

“It’s not busted!” you protest.  “See?  The location data is updating properly.  If there was an uplink error it would tell me!”

Your wife shrugs.  “Then maybe you’re just bad at reading it.”

Your pride does not allow you to even entertain that option.  Surely there’s something else at play here.  But what?  And… even if you knew what it was, what, exactly, are you planning on doing about it?

“Let’s just stop and ask for directions,” Revissa eventually suggests.  You raise an eyebrow at the absurdity of the statement.  “What?  I’m a druid, remember?  I can talk to plants!”

For some reason, some sort of stubborn, primal part of your psyche feels opposed to that plan.  You can figure it out, you just need more time!  If anything, Revissa is the one being unreasonable, doubting your pathfinding skills!  Surely you’ll reach your destination eventually.  The forest isn’t *that* big!  

Though… maybe she would be happier with you if you just went along with her idea anyway.  Wives can be like that sometimes.  Or you could just give up entirely and head back the way you came in defeat.

(if: $lewdpollen is true)[And… come to think about it.  All of this walking has made you surprisingly… hot and bothered.  In fact, just looking at your gorgeous wife makes you bite your lower lip in desire.  Maybe what everyone needs right now is a bit of… relaxation.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="FA04" tags="" position="1300,1150" size="100,100">The adventure can wait.  Revissa is clearly interested in the local plants, and she deserves the chance to investigate them to her heart’s content.  What kind of wife would you be if you pulled her away from that?  Especially considering how much she has given up, living with you in a cramped, broken-down starship.  She’s a student of nature, an animist, a druid, someone who loves the outdoors even more than you do - and, given her life’s history, has considerably more first-hand experience living in it.  

And so, in deference to this, you don’t interrupt her as she studies the fantastical flora of this strange world.  Instead, you just quietly walk up beside her, laying a gentle hand on her shoulder as she looks into the bulb of some sort of pink-ish colored blossom.

“What’cha lookin’ at?” you begin to say, but you don’t even get two syllables in before the unexpected pressure of your hand causes Revissa to yelp in surprise!

You should have known better.  Despite all her training and experience, she still has the instincts of a deer - a prey animal.  She practically leaps into the air from your startling presence, losing all concentration over whatever ritual she was conducting with the plant.  As a result, the bulbous bulb opens and lets out a pungent puff of pollen, filling the air around the two of you and making you both sneeze.

And so, your only reward for trying to be a conscientious and accommodating spouse is a dirty look and a painful jab in the shin with the butt of her staff.  Chivalry really *is* dead.  In no further mood to talk, she just sullenly follows after you as you proceed with your adventure.  As before, there are three paths before you.

It seems even cleaner this high up, perhaps fortified by some winds blowing in from the cliffs up above.  Revissa seems happy as well, even going so far to shrug off her clothing and stand naked amongst the trees, drinking in the beauty of the world around her.  Though if you’re being perfectly honest, the most beautiful thing here is her.  Your heart races as you watch the wind flick her long hair braid around behind her, and an errant beam of sunlight filters through the trees to highlight the ritual tattoos on her gorgeous body.

It’s all so perfect… but you can think of a way to make it even better…

But today, you’re feeling guilty for messing up her flower studies, so you decide your lovely wife deserves a treat.  A treat in the form of you pouncing on her and rolling her onto her back, pressing up against her as you press her with kisses.

Revissa, thankfully, is completely into it.  Seems she got just as heavy a dose of that pollen as you did.  And neither of you are in any mood to try and fight it.  That’s part of why you love her so much.  For all her bluster, she’s just as much of a horn-dog as you are.  Your sex life as you travel the stars is incredibly active and wonderfully varied, and Revissa is always happy to indulge all your weirdest desires.

Today, however, your only desire is to make her scream out in ecstasy.  And to achieve that goal, you pull out all the stops.  The two of you roll through the brush as you roll in the hay, panting and moaning and working up quite the sweat.  All the local critters smartly scatter away as you tumble around amongst the leaves, because neither of you are putting much effort looking out for where you’re going.  A dereliction of duty for the nature druid among you, to be sure.  And as it turns out, a rather critical one.

About half an hour into your steamy encounter, you stumble backwards towards the hollowed out tree you spied earlier, teeming with cute fuzzy spiders.  Spiders which, unlike the other nearby fauna, had not abandoned their posts even as the love-making giants thrashed about.  Which means that the two of you end up with skin and fur covered in highly alarmed and deeply annoyed spiders as the wood of their home splinters around you.

“Oh no … sorry about that — yeee-ouch!” Revissa yells.  Several of the little buggers have climbed on top of her, biting her with tiny, but highly effective fangs.

The same happens to you.  Despite it being your fault, you still snarl in annoyance as your naked skin gets peppered with welts.  Just wanting to get out of here as fast as possible, you stand up, shaking your body frantically to dislodge as many of the pesky critters as you can.  But then, suddenly, you feel woozy.  Your legs lock up, you stumble forward, then fully fall right back down to the floor.

“P-paralytic… v-venom…” Revissa murmurs.

“And r-really… p-potent…” you stammer, as your limbs stiffen and your muscles lock in place.

And just like that, the two of you become completely frozen, naked and helpless, among a nest of angry arachnids.

[[Suffer the consequences-&gt;FB03A]]

The tiny spiders&#39; venom worked quickly and effectively, utterly immobilizing you and your wife before you had a chance to scramble away.  The two of you can only lay there, staring helplessly into each other’s eyes, as the daunting realization sets in that you are both entirely at the mercy of these cute, fuzzy creatures.

There is, at least, a bit of good news - the spiders are vegetarians.  As you lay there you can see nibbles taken out of the nearby leaves.  That’s a relief.  The bad part is - they are also fiercely territorial, and the entire colony has gone into high alert mode now that their home has been endangered.  For them, the top priority is neutralizing the threat they have been faced with.  And as spiders, they know exactly one way to get that done.

That they manage to completely cocoon the two of you in the space of ten minutes is not all that surprising to you.  There are, after all, hundreds of the little guys to spread the work out amongst them.  That they know how to apply leverage to bend your legs at the knees and wrench your arms behind your back is slightly more surprising.  When they start to gag you it begins to dawn on you that there must not only be strength, but also intelligence in numbers.  And… maybe even a bit of perversity, considering they don’t expend any silk to cover your chests.  Or perhaps they just know it isn’t necessary, since even with the amount they use, it’s clear the two of you aren’t going anywhere.

But beyond on all that, what shocks you the most is the spiders even managed to hoist the two of you into the air.  They form a complicated system of winches and pulleys with their silk, treating the two of you like a construction project.  A heavy branch high up is used as a counterbalance, anchored to you with webbing then gnawed away from its tree so it falls to the ground, yanking you and Revissa upwards in the process.  And once there, you’re fastened with more expertly woven tethers to keep you suspended above the ground, now unable to get any leverage or support to enact an escape.

To put it bluntly - you’re screwed.  Even after the venom wears off and you’re no longer paralyzed, the taut silk ensures you are both completely, utterly incapable of mounting even the most basic of escape attempts.  The only consolation is that this is *all* they seem to want to do with you.  Once the threat to their home is properly contained, the spiders all skitter away, leaving you both trussed up in the air above them.

Thinking back to your briefing, you recall that all the material on this spectral planet is made of ‘ghost matter’, meaning that so long as it is touching you, you won’t need to eat or sleep, nor will you even age a day.  That’s good… because it seems likely you’ll be stuck here for a long, long time…

But, bound and gagged as you are, expertly anchored to a number of strong, sturdy trees, you make not even a lick of headway in escaping.  And when those days turn into weeks, and then months, you eventually just stop trying at all.  It’s pointless to bother - nothing you do has any effect.  

And as the months become years, and the years become centuries, the two of you become a literal part of the forest.  Birds build nests on your head.  Little critters take up residence beneath the floof of your tail.  Frightened animals hide from predators by scrunching themselves up between your exposed breasts.

You have no idea what happened to the rest of your crew, but it eventually becomes clear they’re never going to find you.  Perhaps they were caught by something else on this planet.  Not a remote possibility, given how even a colony of tiny spiders managed to trap you and Revissa with such complete finality that it is becoming clear the rest of your lives will be spent here.

At least Revissa finally got her wish to spend more time enveloped in nature.  You just wish you had a bit more freedom in the matter.

Eventually, you are forced to concede that escape is impossible - all you can do is wait quietly and hope for rescue.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of the adventure.  And so as the hours drag on, you pray that’s enough to lead someone out here to find you.  

In the end, it happened while you were asleep.  Krysta and Vhaja found their way to your location and cut you down, carrying you back to the Lucky Break, where they took the time to properly remove all the webbing from your body.  It was almost like peeling off a second skin.  Though thankful to have been saved, you are then delivered the unfortunate news that the data collection devices were damaged by the elements - making your mission a failure.

So that leaves you with no choice to head back into non-restricted space with your tail between your legs.  Maybe next time, you’ll be more careful.  If there even is a next time - Vhaja sure won’t be contacting you again for any more missions.

A few minutes later, your clothing has been hastily discarded, and you are passionately pressed against your darling wife, panting loudly as you try to bring her over the edge.

Warm kisses, gentle nibbles, and dexterously applied fingers accomplish the task quite effectively.  You leave your wife happy, lethargic, and totally covered in sweat.  She smiles, leans over to kiss you, then wraps her arms around your body, content to just lose herself in the moment with you.

Brilliantly colored leaves on the ground, strong, healthy trees stretching upwards as far as the eye can see, and a naked deer girl happily bathing in the warm patches of sunlight flickering beside her.  You’ve never been much of a naturalist, but even you can’t deny there is a transcendental beauty to the scene you’ve found yourself in.

Eventually, Revissa drops into a meditating position, folding her legs and closing her eyes.  Her breathing slows, as she begins to commune with the forest around her.  You’ve seen her do this before - but not, perhaps, as often as you’d like.  Rare are the opportunities for you to immerse yourself in the beautiful outdoors like this.  

Seeing no reason to disturb her, you just lean back against the log and close your eyes.  Your own breathing slows, as you try to do your best approximation of Revissa’s meditation.  Breathe in, breathe out.  In, and out.  Let your mind wander.  Forget about your body, forget about your mission, just immerse yourself in the comforting sounds of the world around you.

Birds singing.  Insects buzzing.  Silken tethers whistling through the air and splatting against naked skin.

…wait, what?

You open your eyes just in time to see Revissa get yanked upwards and out of sight, caught by someone’s sticky fishing line of webbing.  Jumping to your feet in surprise, you follow the path she had taken, casting your gaze upwards towards the cliff face looming overhead.  And that’s where you spy the culprit of your wife’s silky abduction.

A pair of gorgeous women stand above you.  For the most part, they have the appearance of elvaans.  Light purple skin and ivory-white hair, shapely bodies clad in form-fitting dresses that show off all of their wonderful curves.  But on their backs are a collection of spindly spider legs, twitching and writhing with powerful strength.  Limp lines of silk fall away from the tips of their back appendages, making clear they are the method by which they weave their stringy tethers.

“Look, sister,” says one of them, pointing towards where you are standing.  “Another one!”

“Ooh… she’s cute too!  I can’t wait to snare her!” says the second.  

She tenses her legs then uses another line of silk to launch herself into the air, bringing her down towards you.  The other one stays behind, kneeling over Revissa and starting to truss her up in a snug, restrictive cocoon.  It looks like your wife won’t be able to help you right now - and if you don’t act fast, you may soon be joining her!

There’s really nothing in the world better than making passionate love to your wife in the middle of a beautiful forest then falling asleep together, enmeshed in the wonders of nature.

Sure, you have a mission.  It’s important, you know it is.  But missions come and go - there will always be more of them, even if you fail your objectives now and then.  But your relationship with your wife is one of a kind, and it’s not something you *ever* want to fail at.  So your eyes droop, then close completely, your breathing slows, and by degrees, you allow yourself to happily drift off.  Darkness takes you as you slip out of consciousness, awash in the gentle sounds of the forest.

“Aww… they really are adorable, aren’t they?”

“It’s true.  They were so cute, all snuggled up like that.  It&#39;s almost a shame to spoil it.”

“Almost.”

“Tee-hee.  Well, they are much cuter like this, wouldn’t you say?”

You awaken to a pair of tittering voices looming over you.  Groggy and disoriented, you try to reach up to brush something sticky you feel on your face away… but find that you can’t.

“...mmph?”

And, when you try to voice your surprise over this fact, you, again, find that you can’t.  It is only at this point that you open your eyes and fully grasp the situation that you’re in.

You’re naked and laying on hard, rocky ground - probably a ledge on the cliffs that were overlooking the forest path you were taking.  A few tentative wiggles against your restraints confirm they are taut and firm.  You’re not going anywhere.

“Oh look!  She’s awake!” says one of the voices.  You turn your eyes to see the identity of the speaker.]

A pair of, admittedly, gorgeous women stand above you.  For the most part, they have the appearance of elvaans.  Light purple skin and ivory-white hair, shapely bodies clad in form-fitting dresses that show off all of their wonderful curves.  But on their backs are a collection of spindly spider legs, twitching and writhing with powerful strength.  Limp lines of silk fall away from the tips of their back appendages, making clear they are the method by which they weave their stringy tethers.

The very tethers with which they wove the wonderfully well-wrapped wolf woman they’ve snared when her guard was down.  Revissa, sadly is in no better a position than you are, completely cocooned from feet to lips.  She awakens and goes through the same process of realization as you just did, then fearfully locks eyes with you.  How the heck are you going to get out of this?]

Revissa appears surprised by your renewed vigor, but by no means does she seem opposed to it.  She just smiles and closes her eyes as you initiate a second round of love-making.  And this time, you pull out all the stops.  The two of you roll through the brush as you roll in the hay, panting and moaning and working up quite the sweat.  All the local critters smartly scatter away as you tumble around amongst the leaves, because neither of you are putting much effort looking out for where you’re going.  A dereliction of duty for the nature druid among you, to be sure.  And as it turns out, a rather critical one.

About half an hour into your steamy encounter, you stumble backwards towards the hollowed out tree you spied earlier, teeming with cute fuzzy spiders.  Spiders which, unlike the other nearby fauna, had not abandoned their posts even as the love-making giants thrashed about.  Which means that the two of you end up with skin and fur covered in highly alarmed and deeply annoyed spiders as the wood of their home splinters around you.

“Oh no … sorry about that — yeee-ouch!” Revissa yells.  Several of the little buggers have climbed on top of her, biting her with tiny, but highly effective fangs.

The same happens to you.  Despite it being your fault, you still snarl in annoyance as your naked skin gets peppered with welts.  Just wanting to get out of here as fast as possible, you stand up, shaking your body frantically to dislodge as many of the pesky critters as you can.  But then, suddenly, you feel woozy.  Your legs lock up, you stumble forward, then fully fall right back down to the floor.

“P-paralytic… v-venom…” Revissa murmurs.

“And r-really… p-potent…” you stammer, as your limbs stiffen and your muscles lock in place.

And just like that, the two of you become completely frozen, naked and helpless, among a nest of angry arachnids.

[[Suffer the consequences-&gt;FB03A]]
]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="FB04" tags="" position="1175,1950" size="100,100">It was a pleasant experience, to be sure, but you remind yourself that you were here for a reason.  You have a mission!  And that should take precedence over your desire to do even more canoodling than you already have.  So, regrettably, you stand up and brush yourself off, then take a look around.  Might there be someplace nearby to wash off all the sweat and dirt you built up during your roll in the grass?

Revissa points upwards, directing your attention to a waterfall flowing down the nearby cliff face.  Well, not so much a waterfall as a … watertrickle?  You’re not really sure what to call it.  It’s a gentle stream flowing forth in a light but steady downpour, and it’s only a few minutes walk from where you are.  Seems good enough for you.  Leaving your gear behind, you move to the water, inviting Revissa to join you beneath the cool aquatic flow.

…can you be blamed if the idea of sexy waterfall bathing sets you off again, and you soon find yourself pressing your wife against the stone and nippling erotically on her ear?  Soon you’re both wet in two different ways, enjoying each other’s company amidst the sound of flowing water around you.

But your ears are still sharp enough to pick out the sound of a pebble dislodging and falling down the side of the cliff to your right.  Your body suddenly tenses, and you put a hand on Revissa’s shoulder to alert her to the sound.  Together, you turn to face it, and are surprised at what you spy, only a few meters away from where you’re standing.

“Look, sister,” says one of them, pointing towards the pile of clothing and equipment you left below them.  “Visitors!”

“Oooh… I wonder where they are now?  I’d love to invite them over to play!”

Like a pair of bloodhounds hot on the trail, they sling themselves down towards your discarded items on lines of webbing and begin pawing through them, looking for a hint as to your location.

Well, crap.  It looks like you got your wish about gorgeous spider-babes.  But you’d have really preferred to face the threat with a weapon in your hand. You give Revissa a nervous glance.  Among the discarded gear is her druidic focus - a wooden staff she uses to channel her spellcraft.  Though she’s not entirely without magic when it’s not in her hand, her range, power, and effectiveness is sorely limited.  Which means, as it stands, the two of you are naked and exposed.  One wrong move and you’ll be snagged!

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="79" name=" FB02AA2" tags="" position="750,1550" size="100,100">The pair of spider women continue chattering excitedly with one another, occasionally taking breaks to lazily grope your exposed chest or squeeze your nicely bound rump.  You’re helpless to do anything about it.  Not that you mind, per se - this is incredibly hot, after all.  If anything, you’d enjoy being teased a bit more.  But alas, the very nature of kinky kidnappings is you have no say in what happens once you’re caught.

Your captors seem split between two choices for your fate.  One is to keep the two of you for themselves as personal playthings, and the other is to give you as a present to someone named Merry.  A third option is only briefly brought up and then summarily ignored, which is to deliver you to their leader and let her decide what to do with you.  At no point is ‘letting you go’ even mentioned.

In the end, they seem to settle on that second option.

“They really are so adorable,” one says.  “Merry will love them!”

“Yeah, cute floofy couples are her favorite,” the other agrees.

You and Revissa are never consulted about what your personal preference would have been.  Other than the occasional groping, you’re both basically ignored.  At one point, you attempt to wiggle and worm your way across the floor to try to get away,  but that just elicits a chuckle from one of the women as she yanks you by the tail and drags you back to where you were.

And so, once their deliberations cease, you are each picked up and slung over a shoulder, then carried off deeper into the cliff region, towards the opening of a dark and ominous cave.

[[Explore your new home-&gt;FB02AA3]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="FB02AA3" tags="" position="625,1550" size="100,100">Inside the cave it&#39;s basically pitch black.  Your eyes are pretty sharp, but even you can’t ever see more than a few feet in front of you at any time.  But the spider women seem perfectly capable of navigating without light, picking out twists and turns through the extensive cave system.  At this point, even if you were to somehow escape the webbing, you’d have no idea how to actually get back to daylight anyway.

Eventually they reach an area that seems to have the trappings of domestic living, and carry you into a section cordoned off by sheets of webbing to be someone’s home.

“Merry, look what we brought you!” says one of the pair.

“You’re gonna love them!” says the other.

Before long, a third spider-woman emerges.  This one has bright pink skin and big, beady green eyes, wearing a pretty silken dress and with fuzzy fur covering her back legs.  She immediately squees in delight when she sees the gifts that have been brought for her.

“Eeeeeeee!  Omigosh!  Look how cute and fuzzy they are!” she exclaims.

You and Revissa can only mewl helplessly into your gags as you are again poked and prodded and groped by the silk-clad cutie.  The pair explain they found you cuddled together in the forest, which only makes Merry happier.

“Aaahhhh!  You two love each other, don’t you!  Well, you should!  You’re both so adorable!  You make the best couple!”  She looks towards the bearer of her gifts.  “And… I can keep them?”

“You can,” one lady says.

“Forever and ever?”

“And ever,” the other agrees.

“Yay!  I promise I’ll take good care of them!  I’ll brush their hair and tails, and I’ll play with them every single day!”

You and Revissa let out a pair of fearful ‘mmphs’ as you realize you’re basically going to be this spider-cutie’s pets.

And so the others leave you in her expert care.  She wastes no time modifying the positioning of your webbing, cutting bits and pieces here and there, but never enough to give you any mobility or leverage to escape.  You and Revissa are pressed up together, arms behind your backs, naked breasts squished together warmly.  It is, altogether… exactly the sort of thing you’ve fetishized about for most of your life.  Can you be blamed if your tail starts wagging back and forth?

Revissa rolls her eyes at your excitement.  Altogether a rather subdued reaction from both of you, considering the fact these ladies have not, at any point, given any indication they plan on letting you go.  ‘Forever and ever’ is a long time, after all.  But at this point, you have no choice in the matter, so you might as well just enjoy it.

To your surprise, you feel a tearing at your lips as the webbing used to gag you is pulled away.  You and Revissa both start to murmur something towards your cheerful captor, but before any words get out your heads are grabbed and pushed together firmly.

“Now kiiisssssss…” she says happily.]

And so kiss you do.  It’s not like you have any choice.  Though maybe you’d have liked to get one final word in.  Because a moment later and globs of silk are woven around the backs of your heads, gluing your lips together into a kiss that will never end.

Well, there are worse fates to endure.

The webbing is surprisingly comfy, taut and snug in all the right places.  It’s like being tucked into bed.  A bed you’re never allowed to roll out of.  

Your owner makes good on her words to her friends.  She really does cuddle and coddle the two of you every single day.  She brushes your hair and tail, reads you bedtime stories, and always makes sure to keep you… stimulated.  Sometimes she does it by rubbing some kind of cream on your bodies that makes you unbearably horny, watching you and Revissa grind against each other to completion.  And sometimes she does the completing herself, either using the fingers on her humanoid arms, or by running a sturdy length of webbing between your legs and pressing it firmly against your crotch.

She dedicates a corner of her cavern home to be your display stand, and keeps the two of you anchored there for every moment of every day.  You’re just toys to her, wriggling in silk on her shelf.  Though at least you’re well-loved.  It’s… an odd feeling.  You had always fantasized about being abducted by a sexy and domineering spider lady, but it turns out a cute and indulging one is just as effective.  You hate to admit it, but maybe there is something in your kemomi blood that yearns to be… tamed.  Domesticated.  Owned.  Because that is what you are now.  A pet, a piece of property.  As the days go by, you feel like, maybe, this is what you’ve always wanted.  

However, about a week into your new life, an opportunity presents itself.  Your captor was going through your personal effects, holding up each item you’d been carrying and quizzing you about what it did.  Of course, gagged as you are, there’s no way for you to reply.  She just responds for you, in a cutesy sing-song voice, the same kind of voice someone might use to speak to their pet cat.  Amazingly… it doesn’t annoy you.  You find it kind of charming. 

But regardless of the fact, when she is done, she sets down two items from your kit onto a table very close by to where you’re bound.  Close enough… that you might just barely be able to brush up against one of them with your floofy tail.  The first item is the runic dagger Vhaja entrusted you with, apparently able to cut even spectral matter.  And the second is your wrist mounted comm device.  Might you be able to make use of one of these things to mount an escape?  Or would you just be fighting against the inevitable.  And, a better question… do you even *want* to escape?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="FB05A" tags="" position="625,1825" size="100,100">Of course you want to escape!  Not that you’re not having fun being toyed with, of course, but the whole point of your obsession with spider bondage is the back-and-forth of it.  The teasing, the domineering, the futile struggles, the mocking voice of your captor when she thwarts yet another of your escape attempts.  Merry is charming and downright adorable, and she makes for a very good pet owner… but you want to be more than a pet!  You want to be a helpless prisoner at the mercy of a sexy jailor!  And you’re not getting that at the moment, which means it’s time to take a stand.

With that dagger, you might be able to cut yourself free!  And while your tail is far from prehensile, if you wag it properly you might just be able to knock it into your bound up hands.  Then with some more maneuvering, you could hopefully start making some progress on escaping.  Obviously, you might nick yourself with the blade in the process, but it would be worth it if it led to you attaining your freedom.

And so, when your captor leaves the room, you get to work.  Wag wag wag, shake shake shake, you flit your tail back and forth, trying to catch the end of the knife in your fur and gently slide it over.  Slowly, slowly, slowly, bit by bit, it gets closer and closer, until, finally, you feel it push over the edge of the table.  Now all you need to do is catch it and –

*Clatter*

–crap!  You missed!  The knife drops to the ground and scrapes against the stone floor of the cave, totally failing to connect with your hand, or any part of the webbing holding you down.  And now there’s no way for you to get it!

“Oh no!  Are you okay?!”

Merry’s voice comes from the doorway as she rushes in, instantly spying the dropped knife.  She runs over and picks it up, quickly moving it away from you.  Then she scans your body inch by inch, checking to see if it cut you anywhere.

“I’m so sorry!  I shouldn’t have left that so close.  You might have hurt yourself!” she says, with genuine concern.  “But it’s okay… I’ll make sure nothing like this ever happens again.  I’ll never leave anything at all near your body from now on, and make sure you’re wrapped up even tighter than before!”

And she does just that.  Even your tail gets wrapped in place against your butt, as the taut silk is pulled in so firmly you can’t even squirm anymore.  Well… so much for that plan.  So much for *any* plan.  You’ll never get another chance to escape again.  From now on, you’ll only ever be a helpless pet… though maybe that’s not so bad, after all.

And you’re not getting that at the moment, which means it’s time to take a stand.

If you could just switch on your comm device, you might be able to alert your friends where you are.  It’s only been a week - surely they haven’t given up on you by now.  And if they know the peril at hand is spider-themed, they might be able to properly prepare themselves to avoid getting captured like you and Revissa were.  It’s not the best plan in the world, but it’s better than nothing.  It’s not like you want to stay here and play house with Merry for the rest of your life.

…right?

Right!  You’re not ready for the drudgery of domestic living just yet.  You have a galaxy to adventure through, and a gorgeous wife to do it with.  As lovely as being smushed up against Revissa is, there’s other parts of her body you want to have the pleasure of touching.  What about her cute little butt?  The back of her head?  Her long slender legs?  That adorable spotted deer tail?  Not to mention the tantalizing cleft between her legs.  There’s a galaxy&#39;s worth of sex positions to try out with her, and you’re not going to get the chance to do it webbed up in the same position for the rest of your life!

And so, the next time Merry leaves the room, you flick your fluffy tail back and forth, gently trying to smack the ‘on’ button of your communicator.  Your tail is by no means prehensile, but you do have some control over it, which you often use to good effect to floofily stimulate your partners in bed.  And now if you could just tap into that tantric talent now, you could potentially give yourself a way home.  

*Swish, swish, wag, wag,* your tail thwaps against the surface of the table.  It’s hard to see what you’re doing, given the positioning of your head, but by degrees you manage to get a hang of things.  In your mind’s eye, you see where the little ‘start call’ button is, and try to depress it, sort of using your tail to nudge the button against a sharp corner.  It is frustratingly slow going, and after ten minutes you feel like it might be impossible.  But just as you start considering giving up, you finally feel a tiny click, and hear a pleasant buzz as the communicator switches on.

After a moment, you hear a voice.

“Melfy?  That you?”  

It’s Krysta!  The call went through!

“Mmpphh!” you yell, lamely.  “Mrrmphhhhgghhhh!”

You wiggle and squirm as hard as you can, causing the webs to make an elastic stretching sound that echoes through the walls of the room.

“You uh… you alright?”

“Mmphhh!” Revissa screams into her gag.

“Huh… sounds like you’re in trouble?  Me too, lemme tell you.  Me and Lumi only just managed to escape from that Knottie camp last night.  They were *real* good with those ropes – and even better at the whole mind-games part of it.  For a while I seriously thought i was gonna be tied up forev–”

“MRRRPGGHHH!” you growl, as loudly as you can.  

“Right… sounds like you need a rescue?  Lemme just lock-on to your coordinates and–”

But then her voice cuts out, as a pink-skinned hand picks up the comm device and switches it off.  Merry comes into your field of vision and gives you a stern look.

“Was that… a friend of yours?” she asks. Your pulse starts to race.  She’s been nothing but sunshine and rainbows up until now… but if she finds out you’ve been trying to escape…

“Well, why didn’t you tell me!” she says.  “If you had friends, you should have invited them over!  There’s plenty of room for everyone!”

Seems like the stormcloud over the rainbow was just concealing more rainbows.

“Anyway, I’ll let my sisters know to expect them!  We’ll get them all wrapped up and comfy, and then we can have a tea party!” she exclaims brightly.

Your heart sinks.  This isn’t good.  Your friends are all talented and competent, but these spider ladies are something else.  You and Revissa were caught by them, after all, and it honestly wasn’t even much of a fight.  If they know to expect company… will they be able to rescue you?  Or even… rescue themselves?

You’re nice and tightly wrapped, snug as a bug.  Your lips are eternally locked with Revissa’s, the two of you given the opportunity to kiss each other to your heart’s content, and to grind against each other whenever you’re horny.  With webbing imbued with the planet’s ghost matter, you never need to eat or sleep, and you won’t even grow any older.  You’ll get to enjoy the loving ministrations of your owner every day, who always keeps you entertained and stimulated.  What more could you ask for in life?  No more scraping by for enough credits to pay for repairs, no more risking your life on dangerous missions.

Now, all you need to do is exist, to be a warm body for Merry to play with when she pleases.  This is… paradise. There’s no need to fight anymore, no need to worry.  This is… your home now.

And, as the days become months, the months become years, and the years stretch on forever, you’re happy knowing you’ve finally found the place in the universe where you belong.

Hours later when it opens, you find yourself on the Lucky Break surrounded by your crew.

As it turns out, Vhaja was able to locate you thanks to your Star Scout distress beacon.  And though they couldn’t manage to save you directly, they did negotiate your freedom with the spider women in exchange for all the data they had gathered on the planet so far.  Sadly, that included giving over the data collection devices, meaning your mission was a failure.  But at least you have your freedom.

Lumina’s wings are neatly lashed together, enough to avoid mussing up her feathers but not giving them any sort of mobility or leverage.  Krysta, meanwhile, is back to her human form, it seems.  The squirrel tail comes and goes, after all.  Though Jyumon probably wishes it was still out, so that Merry would have something else to occupy her.

As it stands, the curvy fox is laid out on the spider-girl’s bed, forced to endure the cheery groping of her exposed chest as Merry chatters on about how much she loves her new pets.  Vhaja glares daggers at you as she impotently spins from the roof, as thoroughly caught and defeated as the rest of your party.

To be perfectly honest, things could not have ended up worse.  Now your entire crew is hopelessly trapped, which also means there’s no one left to come and save you.  All six of you are naked, save for Merry’s silken restraints, bound tightly and thoroughly enough to prevent any thought of wriggling free unaided, and cut off from making any sounds other than angry grunts or plaintive mewls.  In other words, you’re screwed.  Merry has you all right where she wants you, and where she wants you is nicely bundled up in her bedroom, forever and ever.

It seems your adventure has come to an end.

Which means there is nothing stopping the long-lived spider girl from keeping you for as long as she wants.  And as it turns out, as long as she wants is for ever and ever and ever.

Thankfully, there is a small, but not insignificant silver lining.  Before the mission began, you took a Star Scout homing candy, which means that as the years go by, your distress sends out signals into space.  And, eventually, a passing scout picks up on it and investigates.  And though they aren’t able to free you directly, they do manage to negotiate some terms with the local spider-gals.  Namely, a promise for your release… in a hundred year’s time.

It’s better than nothing.  But until that day, there’s not much to do but submit to Merry’s playful whims.  You and your crew spend the rest of your long, long prison sentence as web-wrapped playthings, toys to be fondled, groped, and cuddled whenever your owner is in the mood.  At least she’s friendly.

You’re naked and defenseless, and those spider-ladies, sexy though they may be, look clearly dangerous.  It would be foolish to try and fight them in your current state.  Better to conceal yourselves and wait for them to leave.  With an anxious whisper, you ask Revissa if she can maybe cook up a camouflaging spell to hide you from their eyes.  She wrinkles her nose in worry, but eventually nods.  She’ll do her best.

She plucks some moss from a water-lodged stone nearby, borrowing some of the life energy within it to weave some primal magic around your bodies.  And, in a flash, you see your skin change in texture and color, becoming not unlike the sandy stone of the cliff face behind you.  Yes!  This is why it’s great to be married to a nature druid!  The two of you press up against the cliff and wait, holding your breath as the spider-ladies continue to investigate the area.

“Hrm… well, they couldn’t have gone far buck naked, could they, sister?”

“I doubt it.  Do you think… they might be hiding somewhere?”

“Oh, they might!  Let’s find them!”

Every muscle in your body tenses as the two arachnid women skitter around the area, carefully searching every nook and cranny for their potential prey.  Little by little, they circle around, at times coming dangerously close to your hiding place… but never looking directly at you.  After about ten minutes, they seem to be growing tired of the ordeal.  You watch as they reconvene on the forest floor below where you are standing and whisper something between themselves.  They’re too far away for you to make out the words, but it seems like they’ve cooled down a bit.  Maybe you’ll be getting out of this after all!

…

In retrospect, that was a stupid thing to think to yourself.  Because the law of narrative dictates that the most dangerous part of a nerve-wracking hiding sequence is right when the victim starts to relax.  And indeed, no sooner do you finally let yourself exhale than the two spider-ladies suddenly spin around, looking right towards the both of you!  You don’t even have a chance to process what is happening before a goopy glob of webbing sticks itself to your chest, forming a taut anchor against your skin which the woman uses to tug you downwards into her waiting arms.

“Gotcha!” she yells, taking advantage of your disorientation to glom some silk over your lips and bind your wrists and ankles together.

“And I got this one!” says the second spider, vaulting up onto the cliff and tackling Revissa to the ground.

Just like that… you’ve been caught.  You make some lame attempts at thrashing and kicking in the spider-woman’s grip, but she has the superior leverage, and soon you’re nicely wrapped up in her impossibly strong silk, unable to do anything but look up at her in helpless fear.

“You almost had us fooled,” she giggles, scooping you up into her arms and slinging you over a shoulder.  “But then I noticed that waterfall… and the way the stream was being disrupted slightly.”

She gives a playful tug on your tail.

“Maybe keep this tucked in better next time and you won’t give yourself away.”

Your heart sinks as you realize it was your own damn fault the two of you have been caught.  But there’s nothing you can do about it anymore.

What you need is to create some kind of distraction to draw their attention away from your gear.  Then you can scoop up your stuff and make a run for it, hopefully avoiding being tracked down.  You whisper a few words to your wife.  Her magical abilities are limited without her staff, but maybe she can still do a bit of shapeshifting?

“Nothing big,” she tells you, “and nothing dangerous.  But maybe a bird or a cat or something.”

That seems as good of a plan as anything.  She’ll turn into an animal and keep them occupied, while you head down to your stuff and gather it up.  You agree on a location to meet back up once you’ve gotten away from them.  The only question is, what kind of animal should she turn into?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="92" name="FB04C" tags="" position="1175,2075" size="100,100">You have no confidence you’ll be able to hide from them.  From experience you know that sexy spider-babes are predators through and through.  They’ve caught your scent, and they won’t back away from it until they’ve caught you too.  Fighting is also out of the question - you’re physically powerful, to be sure, but spider silk is stronger than steel.  In all your past dealings with web weaving hotties, brute force was never the solution.  Stamina and adrenaline only get you so far, and once it’s gone, all that’s left is the unbreakable tension in the silken fibers wrapped around you.

So… your best bet is to talk it out.  Make a deal.  Maybe offer them something.  Don’t present yourself as a threat, and maybe convince them their best interest would be better served letting you go free.  At the very least, spending some time talking might give you the opportunity to think of a better plan.

In a low whisper, you explain to Revissa your thinking.  She doesn’t like it, but she also doesn’t have any better ideas.  So with one last quick kiss, you step out into view and call to the ladies below you.

“Hey try not to get the stuff too dirty,” you call out playfully to them.  “I just had a bath.”

Both of them immediately wheel around to face you, eyes zeroing in predatorily.  

“Ohhh… she’s cute!” one lady says.

“I’m more than cute,” you reply eagerly, hoping your enthusiasm piques their interest in what you have to say.  “I’m resourceful, too.  I’ve actually got some information about this planet you might be interested in — ack!”

You are cut off as a line of silk shoots out from the tips of one of their back legs at astonishing speed.  Your instincts are enough to help you dodge the first one, and your reflexes help with the second.  But your agility comes short at avoiding the third one as it manages to snare you around the ankle.

“Gotcha!” yells the arachnid woman from below, giving a powerful tug on the fishing line to drag you backwards towards the edge of the cliff.

Frantically, you scramble to hold onto something, but your fingers come up short, and then suddenly you’re airborne.  It’s not too far of a drop, you know, but you still go into survival mode as you feel the wind whip through your hair, bracing yourself for a rough impact.  Instead, you land against something warm, soft, and springy - a web net quickly woven to safely stop your descent, spread between the spider-lady’s spindly back legs.

Your mind, to its credit, quickly comes up with a snarky quip.

“Oh, so *this* is where I left my hammock!”

The lady responds to your brilliance by roughly dropping you to the ground then pinning you there with her body.  You wince as her knee digs into your chest.

“Okay – ow!  But really… hear me out.  I have something to offer you — hrrmpgh!”

Your words stop as your lips get sealed with a thick glob of silk.

“The only thing prey like you has to offer is your adorable little body,” she says, as more tethers weave themselves between her back legs.

…well crap.  This went about as bad as it possibly could have gone.

A panicked squeak rings out from above you, followed by the sounds of a brief scuffle.  And then the voice of the second spider-lady calling out.

“You were right, sis - there *were* two of them.  And number two is even cuter than number one!”

“Have you got it under control?” asks the first lady, as she pins your arms to your side and wraps your ankles together tightly.

“Yup!  Spinning her up now!”

Correction.  With Revissa caught too, *now* things have gone as bad as they possibly could have.

You put up some token resistance, but it doesn’t really amount to much.  Instead you just get spun round and round, helpless to resist as warm, wet silk cools and contracts around your body.  As expected, your physical strength proves useless once the cocoon is fully woven around you, not providing even an inch of give as you squirm uselessly against it.  Your voice comes out in fearful, mewling grunts, your gagged lips unable to form any coherent words.

At times you think of trying to wriggle free and throw yourself back down to the forest floor, but you know that won’t do you any good.  She’ll just scoop you up once more.  At this point, any opportunity for resistance has passed.  You’re caught, and nothing you do is going to change that.

It doesn’t take long for her to reach the cliff face once more.  And when you arrive, you see that the other lady has been occupying herself by playing with Revissa’s cocooned form.  She, like you, has been rendered totally powerless, able to do little more than writhe meekly in the grip of her captor.

Once she lands, the one who caught you sets you down next to your wife, letting the pair appreciate the sight of their two catches side by side.

“They really are adorable, aren’t they?” one coos.

“They are!  And for once, they’re all ours!  Tula doesn’t know they’re here…” says the other.

“Which means, we can have them all for ourselves!  Our secret little treasure stash!” giggles the first one.

You and Revissa exchange panicked glances.  Caught like you are, it’s obvious you won’t be escaping under your own power.  But the way these ladies are talking… it sounds like they have every plan to keep the two of you as their personal playthings.  Things are looking quite dire indeed…

…even if this is the kind of thing you fetishize about every night.  

“Grrmmpgghh!” Revissa yells futilely into her gag.  She kicks and thrashes, but accomplishes nothing more than providing entertainment for the pair of spider-y cuties.

“Aww… I don’t think she’s happy about the arrangement!” says one of them.

The other one kneels down and cups her chin with a hand.  “Well… too bad for her.  Because we caught her, fair and square.  And we’re never… *ever* gonna let her go… are we sis?”

“Never ever!” the other one says brightly.  “You two will be our little secret!  We won’t have to share you with anyone!”

“But don’t worry… we’ll play with you.  Every.  Single.  Day.”

The other one does the same to Revissa.  And then, in a fit of giggles, they have their way with the two of you.  Groping, fondling, cuddling, kissing, teasing, stimulating, ravishing, every inch of your bodies a playground for their wickedly erotic desires.  Even Revissa, defiant as she was, eventually succumbs to the pleasure, getting reduced to a mewling, orgasmic puddle by their dextrously probing hands.

It’s several hours later when they’ve finally had their fill with the two of you.  Once they do, they pick you both up and drag you to an alcove in the craggy cliff face, finding a little gap that’s shielded from the elements and not immediately visible - unless you know what you’re looking for.  They layer the space with gobs of webbing, forming a sticky net into which they deposit their two squirming prizes.  Both of you are too tired, too defeated to even pretend at fighting back.  And soon your cocooned bodies are fastened in place, tautly tethered amongst the stands of the net.]

As the pair of sisters admire their handiwork, Revissa makes a few plaintive wiggles, mmph-ing weakly into her gag.  That just makes them laugh all the more, confident in the inescapability of your bonds.  And then with one final squeeze of your breasts, they skitter away, leaving you alone in their hidden alcove.  You both writhe helplessly for a few hours more after they leave, but it is entirely without use.  There’s no way in hell you’ll ever be able to escape… meaning all you can do is hang here and await your next visit.

Over your shoulder, you see Revissa has morphed herself into a bright green chimpanzee, hooting and hollering and rolling around while screeching wildly.  Despite it being your own plan, you still flatten your ears against your head in annoyance at the sound.

But it does seem to do the trick.  Both spider-ladies immediately pick up on the noise and sling themselves up to the cliff area to investigate, giving you the chance to climb down in their wake.

“What is this thing?” one of the spider women asks.

“I don’t know - other than that it’s annoying!” says the other.

So far, so good.  You make excellent progress, quietly slinking to your pack.  All you need to do is scoop everything up and get out of here, and you and Revissa can meet up later.  At least… that’s what you hoped.

“Well whatever it is, I’m going to shut it up!”

You hear the *thwap* of silk firing from spinnerets, followed by something slamming against a rock wall.  And then Revissa’s surprised voice groaning in pain.

“Woah - it turned into a cutie!”

“Well… don’t just stand there!  Wrap her up!”

Crap crap crap!  You scramble to pick up your things, even as you can hear Revissa being made short work of as silk spins around her.  It looks like you’re going to need to rescue her!  But at least you’ve got your gear now–

You get slammed to the ground as a sticky glob of webbing gloms onto your back.  Not good!  For a few moments you flail about lamely, trying to get free… before a many-legged shadow looms above you.

The subsequent attempt to spin around and face her is met with more pressure, pinning you in place.  Followed by spindly legs picking you up and starting to twirl you round and round.

Behind you, you see that Revissa has changed herself into a solar phoenix-wren, a tiny bird with feathers coated with ultra-reflective gloss that magnifies the intensity of the sun tenfold as a defensive mechanism.  It’s so bright you can barely see where you’re going as you shimmy towards the end of the ledge.

More sounds of inexpertly aimed web snares missing their target echo through the forest, allowing you to get to your pile of gear unmolested.

You never feel hungry or thirsty, despite being left alone for, sometimes, days on end, and, as the months give way to years, and then centuries, you never age a day.

No rescue ever comes for you.  You have no idea what happened to Vhaja and the rest of your crew.  It’s entirely possible they were also captured by spider ladies, or by something else on the planet.  Or maybe they spent some time looking for you but eventually were forced to leave.  Either way, it leaves the two of you here, as nothing but helpless playthings to be enjoyed by your captors.  And here is where you will spend the rest of your life, never knowing the taste of freedom again.

GAME OVER

[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="99" name="FB02BY" tags="" position="1425,1675" size="100,100">The spider ladies do come back the next day.  And the day after that.  And the next one, too.  Over the next few weeks, they visit you religiously, making it part of their daily routine to grope and fondle you to their heart’s content.  With nothing else to keep you occupied, it becomes the highlight of your day, the only distraction from the tedium of being a web-wrapped damsel hidden away from all prying eyes.

You never manage to escape.  The webs are too tight, too well-woven.  Towards the beginning you would spend hours, thrashing and squirming, but despite your strength you never make so much as a single tear.  After the first few days, you stop trying.  The only small consolation is that the ‘ghost matter’ properties described in your briefing seem to apply to the webbing used to restrain you.  You never feel hungry or thirsty, despite being left alone for, sometimes, days on end.

It’s only thanks to the Star Scout tracking beacon that help ever comes for you.  One day, shortly after your daily groping session, you hear a rustling from the ground beneath you, as Krysta scurries up and slices away the webbing tethering you in place.  Then she and Lumina carry you back to your ship, parked on a nearby rock outcropping.  They make it in just as the spider ladies return, and narrowly avoid getting captured themselves.  

Sadly, there was no time to recover the data collection devices, and so the research mission is a bust.  But at least you escaped with your freedom.  Maybe next time, you won’t wish so hard for a steamy encounter with a sexy spider lady.  Because while you got your wish, it came at the expense of the mission’s success.

GAME OVER

[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="100" name="FB02BA" tags="" position="1300,1425" size="100,100">It’s clear these women are attempting to capture you - which means there’s no option but to fight!  Watching the spider lady drop through the air towards you, your hand reaches for the blaster pistol at your side.  Though you’re better in melee than at range, you get the sense this lady isn’t going to give you the chance to close the distance to her.

Unfortunately, she’s moving too fast for you to get a good bead on her either.  Maybe it’s a shot Krysta could have pulled off, but your aim has never been anywhere near as good as hers.  The blaster’s energy discharge goes wide, leaving scorching holes in a nearb tree and causing birds to flutter away in a chorus of wingbeats.  Plenty of damage done - but not to your target.

That missed opportunity proves to be the last one you get.  As she lands, her back legs twitch, sending out a half-dozen lines of webbing hurtling towards you with far better precision than you had just shown.  One catches your wrist, glomming up the gun in your hand, and another strikes your face, locking your lips beneath a layer of warm webbing.  A third wraps around your waist, giving your opponent a perfect piece of leverage to yank you into her waiting grip.

Thrown off balance, all you can do is make a surprised ‘mmph’ sound as the lady uses the sharp points of her legs as a knife to slice away every inch of your clothing.  You try to squirm from her grip, but she doesn’t let you keep your balance long enough to accomplish much of anything.  Instead, she just starts spinning you round and round, winding layers of warm, wet silk over your defenseless body.  And by the time the dizziness abates, you find yourself totally wrapped from your feet to just below your nose.

“Gotcha!” the spider lady says brightly, leaning in to give you a quick kiss on the cheek.  You can do nothing but squirm helplessly in her grip.

Sensing her prey is thoroughly restrained, she gives you one last friendly squeeze on the rump then slings you over her shoulder, heading back up to the cliff face she descended from.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="FB02BB" tags="" position="1300,1550" size="100,100">Revissa’s been snagged, and you don’t know the first thing about these women’s offensive capabilities.  As embarrassing as it is to admit, your best choice is to make a run for it.  Once you’ve put some distance between them, maybe you can find a way to sneak up on them and regain the advantage.

It’s not the best plan, but it’s the only one you’ve got.  Leaving your rest spot behind, you rush into the trees, not even bothering to look back as you plunge recklessly into the forest.  Right now, the most important thing is to just not get caught yourself.  Only once you’re sure you’re safe can you figure out where to go from there.

You duck under branches, leap through bushes, and barrel past confused wildlife, making a lot of noise, but hopefully going fast enough that your pursuer won’t be able to follow.  Though, after a while, you slow your steps and proceed with more caution, doing your best to cover your tracks and thoroughly give the spider-lady the slip.  In the back of your mind, you realize in your haste you’ve also completely lost your bearings, meaning that getting back to where Revissa was is going to be a huge pain.  Luckily, you still have the map on your comm device - but as you glance down at it, the readings don’t seem to make any sense.  Have you gotten even more lost than you thought?  Or is there something supernatural at play here messing with your navigation?  Maybe you’d have a better chance of understanding it if you’d explored this part of the forest before rushing blindly though it.

Either way, you finally decide you’ve gone far enough, and slump down against the trunk of a tree to catch your breath.  Your heart is pounding, pulse racing, body both tense and exhausted from the chase.  And now that you finally have a moment to close your eyes and think, you have the time to regret abandoning your wife to whatever fate those dangerous (though also undeniably sexy) spider ladies have for her.  Were you wrong?  Should you have stood and fought?  What if you never see her again?

You might have been plagued by self-doubt for much longer than that, but thankfully, the next few minutes leave the point moot.  Because as you lay there, trying to calm yourself, you suddenly feel a pressure on the back of your head, a hand pulling you forward so that your lips meet a woman’s tender kiss.

“Mmmph?”

Opening your eyes, you see the spider lady who was chasing you suspended upside down on a length of webbing.  Instantly, you try to pull away, but several globs of webbing rain down to restrain your ankles and wrists against the tree behind you.  This gives her the chance to enjoy every instant of her long, passionate kiss, saliva dripping from her mouth as she finally pulls away.

You look up at her with terror and confusion, but she just smiles and pokes your nose.

“I figured you deserved a little reward for giving me such a good workout,” she says brightly.  “But now, let’s get you wrapped up and back together with your cute little friend.”

Stuck and exhausted, you are unable to put up anything even resembling a fight.  A slash from the sharp point of one of her back legs cuts away your clothing, then a gentle spin from her humanoid arms sends you whirling round and round as the silk emerging from her body coils you up nice and tight.  Soon you’re bundled up completely, from the feet to just below the nose, bound, gagged, and totally at your pursuer’s mercy.

“There we go!” she says happily.

She gives your butt an affectionate squeeze as she lifts you up, slings you over her shoulder, and carries you back to the cliffside with no trouble at all.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="FB02BC" tags="" position="1300,1700" size="100,100">You quickly take stock of the situation.  They were able to snag Revissa and pull her in from several yards away, hoisting her easily through the air.  That suggests they are both physically strong and dangerously accurate with their web shooters.  Which means fighting is a dangerous proposition - but running is too.  More likely than not, all you’d manage to do is tire yourself out before getting overpowered and wrapped up anyway.

Better, then, to try the diplomatic solution.  You’ve always thought of yourself as having something of a silver tongue.  Or, at least, a tongue good enough at other things that women who have you at their mercy decide to let their guards down around you.  Hopefully you’ll be able to maintain that streak of luck.  As the spider woman drops down in front of you, you make a motion of raising your hands above your head, trying to communicate non-violent intent.

“Now hold on… let’s just talk this out,” you say to the lady as she lands about twenty feet away from where you’re standing.

She tilts her head to the side.  “Oh?  And what exactly do we have to talk about?”

“Well… rather than just kidnapping both of us straight away, don’t you think you should find out who we are and why we’re here?”

The lady considers for a moment.  “I suppose so.  But I want some assurance you won’t try to pull one over on me while we chat.  Toss away your weapons.”

Your body tenses.  Without weapons, you’ll be at a severe disadvantage.  But you were already at that point anyway.  Might as well fully commit to talking things over.

With a nod, you pull your sword from your back and your blaster from its holster, and throw both off to the side.

“Hmm… but how do I know you’re not hiding something else on you?  I think you’d better strip down entirely.”

You suppress the urge to smile.  This is actually exactly what you wanted.  Once she sees how fit and sexy you are, she’ll probably want to get intimate.  And if she’s getting intimate, she’s letting down her guard.  A perfect opportunity for you to get the drop on her.  Or, worst case scenario, at least she’ll take a liking to you.

And so, with careful movements, you begin peeling off your clothes.  Boots and pants, cape and shirt.  You make a bit of a show out of it, swaying your hips and flexing your muscles to really give her a sense of what you’ve got to offer.  And from the looks in her eyes, she likes what she sees.  Once you finally wiggle out of your panties and drop them to the floor, you cock an eyebrow in her direction, letting her dictate the next move.

“Now then… walk towards me.  Slowly.  No sudden moves.”

Excellent.  Looks like she’s eager to sample the goods after all.  You do as you’re told, swishing your tail enticingly as you slowly draw near.  Her eyes never leave your body as you advance.

“Now then,” she says as you stop right in front of her.  “Hold perfectly still.”

From this distance, you can see that she is a bit shorter than you, at least in terms of her humanoid frame, but she can still tower over you when she uses her back legs to lift herself up.  She does just that as she casts an appraising eye over your naked body.

“Yes… you’ll make a lovely toy…” she says, leaning her face in close.  You don’t resist as her lips meet yours and you share a long, greedy kiss with her.

“Oh… I can do much more than be a toy,” you say with a smirk when she pulls away.

She smirks as well.  “Maybe so… but a toy is all I want you for.”

And then everything becomes a blur.  You feel her tackle you to the ground.  You feel your wrists get snagged by silk, then your arms forced behind your back.  The ground pulls away from your legs as your body spins round and round, faster than your mind can keep up with.  A glob of silk forced over your lips, and a taut cocoon woven expertly around your naked form.  By the time she lets you go, webbing has covered your figure from the tips of your feet to just below the nose, leaving you completely bound and entirely at her mercy.

Fear fills your eyes as you realize she never had any intention of negotiating.  She just chuckles and gives you an affectionate squeeze on the butt, before hoisting your wiggling body up and slinging it over a shoulder.

Then with a graceful leap, she slings back towards the cliff face, her new package in tow.

It had started as a tiny ember of desire, but as you walked it has grown and grown, until it’s fully progressed into a raging inferno.  You can’t hold it back any longer - your needs simply must be satisfied!

Luckily, Revissa seems just as on board with the plan as you are.  Her clothes come off just as quickly, her breath hot and heavy as you press your naked body down on top of her.

“The pollen… from earlier,” she murmurs, speaking of the flower that had sprayed the two of you at the entrance of the forest.  “I think it must have had… some kind of aphrodisiac quality to it.”

Her words serve as an explanation, but not a solution.  But mostly they just serve as a distraction from you getting what you want, so you solve the problem by covering her lips with your own.

She makes no protest as your bodies become one, your cries of euphoria echoing between the forest trees.  It is a moment of pure passion, of deepest desires fulfilled, of raw ecstasy, of absolute pleasure, and the two of you lose yourselves in each other’s embrace for what feels like hours.  But eventually, the effect of the pollen begins to wear off, allowing your senses to return - which is when Revissa notices something amiss.

“We’re being watched,” she says.

You humor her by looking around, but all you see is more forest.  But from the way she’s suddenly become tense, you can tell this isn’t something she’s just going to drop.  Which means, regrettably, no post love-making cuddles in your immediate future.

“There!” she says, pointing at a neary tree.

You raise an eyebrow.  As far as you can tell, there isn’t anything unusual about it.

“Ugh, you wouldn’t understand.  But I can tell that it’s watching us.  And I’m going to ask it what it wants.”

A hoarse, craggly voice suddenly cuts through the quiet of the forest, as apertures open in the tree’s bark in rough approximation of eyes and a mouth.  “No need to ask,” the tree says.  “Besides… I’ve already gotten what I want.  What a lovely show that was.  I haven’t seen such passion in years!”

You’re not prone to embarrassment, but your cheeks still color at the realization someone had been watching your raunchy love-making session.  You cough awkwardly, then glance towards Revissa, who seems just as tense as ever, even though her mysterious audience has been revealed.

    After the incident with the fae, Revissa seems less upset with you than she had been previously over getting lost.  It’s entirely possible the mysterious trickster had a hand in it.  At the very least, you’re not entirely to blame.  Though it doesn’t change the fact you still have no idea where to go.  This time, however, you and Revissa work together as a team to try and pick your way though, with you keeping an eye glued to your comm’s map display while she picks out signs from the natural world around you.
](else-if: $predstory is true)[
    Armed with the knowledge from Revissa’s story, you push forward even more stubbornly than before, heading in the direction you think to be north, even when the map on your comm tells you that you’ve been turned around.  If there’s some kind of psychic monster trying to trip you up, you’re not going going to give it the time of day.  Eventually you stop looking at the map entirely, relying on nothing more than your innate sense of direction to help you advance.
](else-if: $faewin is true)[
    You’re not going to back out now - not after you fought so hard against the mysterious trickster to get this far.   And so, you lead Revissa deeper into the woods, trying your best to navigate towards the destination on your map.  But once again, try as you might, the readings you are viewing on the comm screen and the surroundings you see with your eyes don’t add up.  Is that woman still messing with you?  Or is there something else in this forest trying to misdirect you.  That thought weighs heavily on your mind as you keep stubbornly pushing forward.
](else: )[
    Revissa is obviously annoyed at you for ignoring her perfectly reasonable solution to the problem, but she doesn’t protest all that much.  Maybe just because she realizes your pride has been wounded.  She’s mature enough to let *you* be immature without much fuss.  Which… only makes you feel more frustrated, which in turn makes you push forward all the more brazenly.  You really want to prove to her you know what you’re doing.
]
Unfortunately, after another hour, you still haven’t made any progress.  Nothing you do seems to work, almost as if the forest itself has willed itself to resist understanding.  Your annoyance grows, and a voice in the back of your head says you need to stop and reassess the situation, but you tell yourself you’ll pause after you circle around the next thich tangle of trees.

Which is when you feel the ground give out from beneath you.  A sickening *splort* fills your ears as your feet sink into the earth, your legs suddenly enmeshed in gooey, viscous liquid.  Looking around, you find that somehow you have walked right into the center of a pit of sticky black tar, laying in a pool smack dab in the middle of a wide clearing.  How you got that far into it before you started sinking defies explanation, but the fact remains that you are here.

“Ack… what is this stuff!” Revissa yells, stuck right alongside you.

Maybe sticking close together wasn’t such a good call, because now both you and your wife find yourselves buried past your shins in gooey tar.  Trying to lift your legs only results in the sticky mire snapping you back down in place, making you sink down even further.  

“I think I’m stuck…” you murmur, your strength useless in pulling you free.  You turn to Revissa.  “What about you?  Can you think of any magic that can help”

“Maybe if I transform into a bird, I can flutter out of here,” your wife suggests.  “Then I can find something to help you.”

You nod in agreement at the plan, even as the suction from the swamp pulls you down past the knees.  Revissa closes her eyes, raising her staff as high as she can while chanting the spell to change her form.  But then… something beneath you reacts.  An unnatural suction force tugs powerfully at your bodies, ripping her staff from her hands and drawing it deep into the muck beneath you.  Both of your clothes are taken with it, as you sink all the way down to your waists.

“What the heck was that?” you yell.

“I… don’t know,” Revissa says grimly.  “This must be something more than a mere swamp.  It has… a consciousness to it, a willpower.  And… it wants us inside of it.”

Well that’s not good news.  Looking around, you find that the wave of suction pulled loose an overhanging vine from a nearby tree, giving you something to hold on to.  You motion for Revissa to grab onto your arm as you tug… but then, as the end of the vine falls into the mire, that same suction force pulls down and snaps it apart.

Revissa raises an eyebrow.  “Well, asking the plants would confirm it, if that’s what you think.”

You wave her away.  You don’t want to talk to any plants.  You just want to double back and start over, maybe pick a different path this time.  Clearly this one isn’t working out.  Revissa simply shrugs in resignation, following after you as you try to retrace your steps.

A tense half hour passes as you try to return to the spot where you started, and, interestingly, when moving away from the forest’s center you actually seem able to maintain your bearings.  Almost as if there really *was* something supernatural at play confounding your navigation.  Revissa eventually chimes in with a thought.

“Actually… I’ve heard about something similar to this before.  During my time in the Bolg Resistance, some guerrillas that specialized in deep forest missions would report getting lost - even in locations they should have known like the back of their hands.  It turned out there was some kind of predator that sent out a sort of … psychic pulse that confused their pathfinding skills and led them into traps.  Maybe there’s something similar happening here as well.”

You consider that information thoughtfully.  On the one hand, if that’s what’s going on here, it would exonerate your lack of directional awareness - so long as you found some way to overcome it.  On the other, at this point you’ve been wandering aimlessly for hours, so it might just be best to cut your losses.

Unfortunately, all you’ve managed to accomplish in the past hour is prove your wilderness skills are not up to stuff - aided by modern technology or not.  Deflated, you nod and ask her to go through with the ritual.

Revissa smiles in that infuriating way where she is pretending not to be pleased with this development, but quite obviously is.  Which on the surface suggests she is trying to preserve your wounded pride, but in truth is an even more subtle jab at your ego, because she *knows* you know what she is thinking, and she *knows* you’d be much less ticked off if she gloated about being right rather than just letting you stew in your own failure.

Love is… complicated in that way.  Because it doesn’t make you angry.  It just makes you start thinking about how you might get back at her later.  An effort you know is futile, since any time you start a feud Revissa ends up winning it - for no better reason than she knows you’re hornier than she is, so the denial of sex is always an ultimatum that you have no choice but to surrender to.  To be honest, that’s part of what makes you love her so much.  There’s something incredibly sexy about a woman who can play you like a fiddle.

Either way, now that the die has been cast, all you can do is plop down on the floor and watch as she performs her signature nature magic, closing her eyes and spinning her staff to tap into the leylines of nature flowing all around her.  It’s not something you can see with your eyes, but your senses are sharp enough that you can still pick up on the changes around you - a susurrus of animal noises, a sharp pang of earthy aroma filling your nostrils, a sort of energy in the air that makes the fur of your tail bristle.  When she is done, she directs that nature energy towards a nearby tree, causing the rough bark on its surface to shift into the shape of a vaguely humanoid face.  

As it slowly opens its eyes, Revissa bows respectfully and delivers a traditional greeting in some ancient druidic tongue.

Your voice echoes between the trees, unanswered.  But you *know* there’s someone out there.  Watching, waiting.  And so, as your body sinks lower with another sickening *splort*, you try again.

“I know you can hear me!” you say.  “And I know you can help.”

Revissa glares at you.  “No, absolutely not.  We’re not getting tangled up with any fae.”

“What other choice do we have?” you plead.  “It’s that or sink.”

“Then we should sink,” she says firmly.

Another tug from the mire, and your arms get sucked under, leaving the two of you submerged halfway past the chest.  At this point there’s no way you’re escaping under your own power.  But maybe Revissa’s right - better the devil you know, as the saying goes.

And that’s when it hits you.  What was it she had said - the predator she was talking about could disrupt the senses, make you believe something that wasn’t actually real.  Well, nothing about this swamp makes any sense.  You somehow fell right into its center while walking, never noticing the edges.  A vine dropped down from nowhere, even though there wasn’t a nearby tree for it to hang from.  The forest itself has been defying your every effort to keep track of where you were going.  Nothing about this is natural.  So maybe… the solution you need to escape is equally unnatural.

Maybe Revissa’s right - there’s some kind of consciousness associated with this swamp, and it has a cruel sense of humor.

With no other options, you lamely toss the lasso as far as it will go, hoping it at least does *something*.  But the only something it does is sink beneath the surface of the tar pit with another sickening *glorp*.  Along with the vine goes your body, as the suction of the swamp pulls hard enough to drag your arms beneath its surface, leaving you buried half past your waist.  At this point, you can’t think of any more options.  Other than the obvious one.

    Thinking fast, you come to a grim realization.  Other than your physical strength, you don’t have many tools available to help you out of this, and that strength has already failed you.  But Revissa knows magic, can transform into animals, can do all kinds of things.  If only one of you makes it out of this pit, it ought to be her.

And so, you wrap your arms around her waist and start hoisting upwards, causing the equal and opposite reaction of making you sink more deeply.  Now down halfway past your waist, with your arms totally submerged, there’s no way you’re going to be climbing out under your own power.

“Melfy, what are you doing?” your wife asks.

“Getting you out of here.  Just close your eyes and concentrate.  Even without your staff, you should be able to turn yourself into a tiny bird or something.  Once you get clear, you can think of something else – or at least make it back to the ship without me…”

There is a long silence… followed by a sudden moment of realization from your partner.  She seems to be distracted by something – something other than your heroic sacrifice.  Has she figured something out?

“Don’t always believe everything you see or hear…” she mutters.  

Those were the fae woman’s parting words.  You’d think Revissa of all people would be suspicious of what she had told you, but in her eyes you see a flicker of understanding.

“Melfy… you trust me?” she asks.

“Of course.”  

“Then close your eyes, and take my hand.  Concentrate on nothing other than the sound of my voice.”

You do as you’re told.  It’s obvious she’s onto something here.  You close your eyes, and you try to ignore the feeling of the muck pulling against your body, of the fact that you’re slowly sinking, that in a few moments your head will be beneath the surface of the inky swamp.  All you do is listen, and wait.

“And now… stand up.”

If it were anyone else telling you to do that when you were in the middle of a tar pit, you’d have told them they were crazy.  But you trust your wife.  You trust her more than yourself, more than even your own senses.  And so, despite the absurdity, you bend your knees, you push upwards… and you stand straight and tall.

Before you have a chance to process what is happening, she clutches her fingers around your wrist and begins to walk forward.  So you follow her. Moving through what should have been impossibly thick tar, but finding it as easy as if you were taking a morning jog.

You’re nice and tightly wrapped, snug as a bug.  Your lips are eternally locked with Revissa’s, the two of you given the opportunity to kiss each other to your heart’s content, and to grind against each other whenever you’re horny.  With webbing imbued with the planet’s ghost matter, you never need to eat or sleep, and you won’t even grow any older.  You’ll get to enjoy the loving ministrations of your owner every day, who always keeps you entertained and stimulated.  What more could you ask for in life?  No more scraping by for enough credits to pay for repairs, no more risking your life on dangerous missions.

To be perfectly honest, you would have been happy here forever.  You had no intention of escaping.  But the Star Scout rescue beacon you swallowed earlier had other thoughts on the matter.  Thanks to the beacon, your crew was able to track you down, and though they couldn’t manage to save you directly, they did negotiate your freedom with the spider women in exchange for all the information they had gathered on the planet so far.  Sadly, that included giving over the data collection devices, meaning your mission was a failure.  But at least you have your freedom.

Though for the rest of your life, you’ll always wonder if you might have enjoyed things more being a pet…

As embarrassing as it is to admit, your best choice is to make a run for it.  Once you’ve put some distance between them, maybe you can find a way to sneak up on them and regain the advantage.

It’s not the best plan, but it’s the only one you’ve got.  Leaving your rest spot behind, you rush into the trees, not even bothering to look back as you plunge recklessly into the forest.  Right now, the most important thing is to just not get caught yourself.  Only once you’re sure you’re safe can you figure out where to go from there.

You duck under branches, leap through bushes, and barrel past confused wildlife, making a lot of noise, but hopefully going fast enough that your pursuer won’t be able to follow.  Though, after a while, you slow your steps and proceed with more caution, doing your best to cover your tracks and thoroughly give the spider-lady the slip.  In the back of your mind, you realize in your haste you’ve also completely lost your bearings, meaning that getting back to where Revissa was is going to be a huge pain.  Luckily, you still have the map on your comm device - though there’s no guarantee those ladies will still be there, even if you do manage to find it again.

Speaking of your map, as you glance at it, you notice something disconcerting… namely, that your position doesn’t seem to be correctly updating.  Or rather, that something might be interfering with it.  All at once, your memories from your previous attempt at making it through the forest come rushing back in, of the strange predator that confused and disoriented you, tried to lead you into an imaginary tar pit.  Could it be that you’ve run so far and so quickly that you’ve stumbled back into its territory?

Your heart beats faster as your mind races to consider your options.  This could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.  On the one hand, you’re doubling the number of creatures trying to capture you now.  But on the other hand… your spidery pursuer might fall into the same trap that you did earlier, only she wouldn’t know how to escape it.

You just need to wait for the spider lady to catch up with you, then start leading her further and further into the other creature’s territory.  She’ll get caught up, and you’ll be able to escape.  Then you just need to retrace your steps, find Revissa, and save her from the second lady who’s gotten her all wrapped up.  What could go wrong?

And so, you slow your movements, trying to make yourself obvious as you plunge further and further towards the middle of the forest.  And eventually you’re rewarded by the sound of skittering from the branches above you.  She’s here!

“Phew… you gave me quite the workout,” she says cheerily, dropping down from a branch above you.

You’d like to say you put up a good fight.  That knowing you had a plan, your confidence allowed you to pull out some kind of amazing distraction that enabled you to escape.  But of course, that doesn’t happen.

Less than a minute after appearing, the spider lady has you striped, bound, gagged, and totally at her mercy.  So much for having a plan.  In the end, it seems like there was nothing you could have ever done to escape your fate.

And yet… after she finishes wrapping you up, the spider-babe seems to get distracted.  She looks around wildly, eyes filled with fear, before stepping away.  You’re not sure what she sees, what memory was pulled from her mind.  All you know is that suddenly she freezes in place, holding perfectly still, hardly even breathing.  And then… she slowly lays down, curls up into a ball, and closes her eyes.

Could it be… has she fallen victim to the same predator who had tricked you into thinking you were sinking?  You wriggle about helplessly in your webs, unable to get closer to inspect the situation.  All you can do is watch as something emerges from the woods.  

This must be it!  The creature that tormented your mind.  The monster that controls the entire central expanse of these woods.  A predator who snags its prey without ever lifting a finger, defeating them with such overwhelming power they never even have the *chance* to put up a fight.

…a bunny?

Sure enough, an adorable woodland creature, with bright green and gold fur, cautiously hops out and pokes the inert spider-gal with its adorable twitchy nose.  Once it confirms she’s incapacitated, it hops up on top of her, curls up and… falls asleep?

Well then.  It looks like the fearsome predator trapping you in its mental prison was actually just an adorable bunny that wanted someplace cozy to take a nap.  Though… you get the feeling, as cute as it is, it had no intention of letting you go if it had actually managed to catch you.  But all things considered… this is probably the most adorable way to get trapped in the forest.

Part of the reason you escaped the swamp trap was because Revissa was with you.  Without her, how could you possibly find the courage and strength to defy your own senses?  

No… it would be too dangerous.  Instead, you start to double back, looking towards your map to see when it starts making sense again.  Unfortunately, you pay a bit too much attention to that, and not to your surroundings.  So you don’t realize you’re being watched until the sudden pressure on the back of your head, and a hand pulling you forward so that your lips meet a woman’s tender kiss.

“Mmmph?”

Opening your eyes, you see the spider lady who was chasing you suspended upside down on a length of webbing.  Instantly, you try to pull away, but several globs of webbing rain down to restrain your ankles and wrists against the tree behind you.  This gives her the chance to enjoy every instant of her long, passionate kiss, saliva dripping from her mouth as she finally pulls away.

You look up at her with terror and confusion, but she just smiles and pokes your nose.

“I figured you deserved a little reward for giving me such a good workout,” she says brightly.  “But now, let’s get you wrapped up and back together with your cute little friend.”

Stuck and exhausted, you are unable to put up anything even resembling a fight.  A slash from the sharp point of one of her back legs cuts away your clothing, then a gentle spin from her humanoid arms sends you whirling round and round as the silk emerging from her body coils you up nice and tight.  Soon you’re bundled up completely, from the feet to just below the nose, bound, gagged, and totally at your pursuer’s mercy.

As you go, you see more slumbering forms scattered about, trapped in the bunny’s mental labyrinth.  Mostly woodland creatures, though there’s a couple humanoids scattered about - a pair of knotties, probably women from the camp who got themselves lost.  You decide not to risk waking them, lest you arouse the fear of the mighty green rabbit.  Though you notice nestled in the arms of the sleeping women are some brightly colored eggs, suggesting they might be contributing to the circle of life by incubating the critter’s descendants.

Either way, you make your way back to where you and Revissa were separated, using your map once the bunny’s psychic distortions allow you to follow it properly.  Eventually you see the cliff face towering above you, and carefully creep up it, trying not to disturb the second gorgeous spider-babe who might be lurking in wait.

You don’t find her – but you do find something else.

Revissa looks up at you fearfully, wriggling ineffectively in a tight silk cocoon.  Not just bound up, but also anchored to the floor and to a rock from an overhanging portion of the cliff up above.  Her lips are sealed, but her breasts are exposed, indicating her captor must have spent some time having fun with her before leaving.

You can’t help yourself, and give her inviting pair a firm squeeze.  It’s so rare that Revissa is the one in need of rescuing and not you.  She rolls her eyes and strains against her bindings, just making her chest bounce all the more obviously.  

“Hold still now,” you say with a chuckle, taking out the runic knife to cut her free.

A few minutes later, Revissa is parted from the silk, and has reclaimed the clothing and gear the spider lady had taken from her.  She explains that her captor had stuck by her for a few hours when her sister had run off into the forest in pursuit of you, but when her fellow arachnid did not return she eventually went searching for her.  It’s just pure dumb luck that the two of you didn’t meet up on your way back, or she probably would have caught you as easily as her sister did.

Either way, it seems like against all odds you’ve managed to escape capture - thanks to the help of an unassuming forest critter.  Revissa hardly believes your story about the bunny as you explain it to her, but admits there’s no reason a psychic predator needs to be a scary and terrifying monster when you’re up close to it.

Now, with the spider ladies gone, it would seem that you have a clear shot to the heart of the forest.  But it’s always possible that more dangers are lurking here in the cliffs.  Perhaps it would be best to double back and try a different route through the forest, just in case?

You and Revissa now find yourselves in the heart of the woods, with only a short trek to your destination remaining, if the map on your comm device is to be believed.

If this were a video game, you would expect this to be the part where the environment grew dark, twisted and foreboding as a boss battle loomed on the horizon, but as a pleasant surprise, the area ahead seems the most welcoming of all the places you’ve yet visited in the forest.  You appear to have arrived at a natural grove of fruit trees, tightly clustered together in this one particular region.  Revissa gives you a complicated explanation for why you hadn’t encountered the fruit trees elsewhere in the forest, taking into account elevation, light levels, soil fertility, and the migration patterns of birds depositing the seeds, but it rather goes over your head.

Instead you just pick up a stray fruit and take a lazy bite.  It’s an iridescent green color and is vaguely shaped like an apple, but has much softer, fleshier skin, giving way to an almost honey-like nectar as you eat.  Revissa sighs as some spills down your chin, chastising you not to eat random things off the ground from a weird grove in the middle of a ghost planet.  You respond by taking another bite.  It really is quite good.

Advisability of partaking of the delectable fruits aside, your map is telling you the data device needs to be set somewhere within the grove, so the two of you push further ahead.  (if: $treetalk is true)[But as you walk, your sharp ears pick up on a rustle coming from the branches up above.

You get the sense that an open confrontation with them would swiftly result in your and Revissa’s quick and decisive capture.  And though you may yearn for the softness of their silk against your skin, you decide to save that for private time with your wife’s spider-form when you get back to your quarters on the ship.

So, tail between your legs, you retreat.  You double back the way you came, trying to keep out of sight of the cliffs above, from whence an arachnid might pounce at any moment.  All things considered, you make good time, and soon your map tells you the entrance to the forest is within sight.  However, as you approach, your ears happen to catch the sound of something rustling nearby in the brush.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, turn to face it.

The two of you proceed for several tense minutes, with Revissa constantly looking behind you for signs of pursuit, and you alternating between checking the map on your comm device and looking out over the horizon to try and pick out the direction towards your destination.  You feel pretty confident that you can get there, but will you be able to do it safely?  Only time will tell.

Either way, the path is ahead of you.  And soon you find yourself plunging into the very heart of the woods.

And because of that, your instincts have been honed to a razor sharp edge, letting you pick up on danger where other women would have continued unawares.

Usually, that experience is a good thing.  Normally, reacting quickly can save your life.  Sadly, this time, it proves to have the opposite effect.  Because as the two of you wheel around in unison, you find yourselves looking right into the eyes of a large, squat, bulky lizard with vibrant scales the same pastiche of colors as the leaves crumpled up on the ground.  

That trained mind of yours, honed by years of instinct, warns you of the threat you now face a micro-second before your body begins to seize up.  You have just enough time to begin to swivel, for your eyes to widen, for your lips to part and for a warning to begin to form on your tongue.  Revissa reacts even faster, holding a hand out in front of her, as if that, somehow, could stop what was about to happen.

What you’ve discovered, creeping up on you in the brush, is a basilisk.  A creature known for its ability to turn flesh to stone as soon as one meets its gaze.  In a universe where you were less perceptive, you might have been better off.  But that’s not the universe you and your wife currently occupy.

Given how many adventures you and your wife have made it through, it’s a rather ignominious way to end this one.  But as your clothing turns brittle and crumples away, and your mind falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, you realize with your last gasp of consciousness that life is not always fair.  The greatest of stories can end in a heartbeat with one mistimed step.  And it seems yours has met just such an unsatisfying conclusion.

After a few minutes, you hear more rustling, then the lazy groan of some local wildlife foraging for food nearby.  A false alarm, it would seem.  But as you leave your hiding place, you explain that if it was your pursuers, then even laying eyes on them might have been a fatal misstep - since then they, in turn, could lay eyes on you.  And you don’t have any confidence you’d be able to give them the slip if they caught your trail a second time.

You’re lucky enough to lay eyes on one of the two women before she spies you, giving you a moment to plan your next move.  She seems to be searching, prowling - hunting for the two of you, unwilling to give up the chase.  But she doesn&#39;t know exactly where you are.  With a frenzied hand motion, you direct Revissa to follow you as you shimmy as quietly as you can inside of a hollowed out log, clutching each other tightly as you press against the rotting bark.

Through a gap in the wood, you can see the spider-woman seemingly catch the scent of something, prompting her to leap into the air, swing along a silken tether, then pounce behind a nearby rock.  But instead of a pair of lovely adventurers, she just surprises some local wildlife.  It lets out a guttural growl, but then retreats into the brush, fleeing from the sudden intrusion.

“Hmmph,” your pursuer says with an honestly quite adorable pout.  “I was so sure they were here…”

She lingers around for a while longer, but eventually leaves without any prey.  You and Revissa wait a good ten minutes after she is out of sight, holding your breath, sweat dripping down your brows, but she does not seem to be circling back.  And so, carefully, quietly, you climb out from your hiding place, and continue your retreat back to the forest entrance.  Hopefully you’ll have better luck on one of the other routes.

You have no confidence you’d be able to escape again if they spotted you.  And so you wrap your arms around your wife and hold her tight as you try to make yourselves as small and quiet as possible.  For several tense moments you stay there, trying to still your breathing, to will yourselves out of existence entirely.

There is the briefest of moments where you think it worked.  But then comes the shadow from above, the spider-woman propelled on a line of silk swinging herself from a tree branch.  She tackles you both to the ground at once, and in the same movement sprays you both with more silk than you could possibly handle.  By the time you come to your senses, you’re already completely restrained, already at the arachnid’s mercy as the sharp points at the end of her back legs begin making short work of your clothing.

“Gotcha!” she purrs dreamily, tossing each of you other a shoulder, totally cocooned, kicking and screaming fruitlessly into silk gags woven over your lips.  

And just like that, you’re captured.  With no choice in the matter, she brings you back towards the cliffs where she makes her home.

Revissa, of course, has been rendered equally helpless.  Her naked body has even less strength than yours to resist, and given how fruitless your efforts have been up until now, hers are even doubly so.  There won’t be any help from her.  After confirming the tightness of her restraints, she fearfully locks eyes with you, as if to ask - how the heck are you going to get out of this?

…of course, the answer is grimly obvious.  You aren’t.  All you can do is lay here and wait to see what happens next.

Once they were women, but now they are nothing but stone.  They cannot see, they cannot hear, they cannot think.  They just *are*.

When the statues were women, they had friends.  Friends who would come looking for them, who would want to cure them, who would want to restore them to what they once were.  The friends never find them.  Is it because the statues were too far lost, too well hidden?  Or is it because those friends have gotten themselves into their own trouble, trouble they can’t get out of.  To the statues, it doesn’t matter.  Their friends never come, but the statues cannot take offense, because stone is incapable of emotion.

As the days pass, as the seasons change, as the moss grows and the granite cracks, as the birds make nests amongst their hair, as the rodents huddle for warmth and protection beneath their feet, as time passes forward, as it always does, the statues remain.  Before long, they are as much a part of the forest as are the trees.  

And there they remain.  Forever.

Frozen, motionless, trapped beneath a canopy of trees and branches.  For the moment, you are no longer women.  You’re nothing but stone.  You cannot see, cannot hear, cannot think.  You just *are*.

The last thing you remember is the shame and embarrassment of being caught in such an unflattering way.  You’re a hero for goddess-sake, you practically saved the galaxy!  How can you keep calling yourself that when you turn a bit too quickly towards a sound in the woods, and become an overgrown paperweight for your troubles?

Lucky for you that you had taken the Star Scout homing beacon.  If not, Vhaja and the rest of the crew would not have been able to find you.  And lucky for you that Lumina knows healing magic, that she could restore petrified flesh into something warm and pliable once more.  Lucky for you that your friends aren’t terribly angry at you, despite the embarrassing way you got yourselves caught.  They had their own problems to deal with while you were stone.

But there is one unlucky thing - along with your clothing and equipment, the data gathering devices were destroyed by the elements while you stood there in stony silence.  The mission is a failure without them, so you’re forced to leave the planet with your tail between your legs.  At least you’re still mobile enough to take on another job, some other day - assuming anyone will hire you for it.

But there’s nothing else to do but accept it.  You and Revissa lock eyes, exchanging fearful glances, knowing that this might be the last chance you have to speak to each other.

“Melfy, I–” your wife begins.  

But you cut her off with a kiss.  It’s impossible to fight the suction of the tar-filled mire enough to break through the surface, but you still have enough strength to find her body within the muck and pull it in close.  When your lips part, you’re both up to your necks.

“Whatever happens next… we’ll be together,” you say quietly.

She sniffles and nods.  “Together…” she agrees.

And so you press your foreheads against one another and close your eyes, as with one final *splort*, you sink completely.  

All around you can hear nothing but the incessant churning of the mire, can see nothing through the thick, all-encompassing tar.  You hold Revissa as tight as you can, with even more urgency than holding your breath.  Your lungs give out before your arms.  

And yet… you don’t drown.  You gasp for air, feeling the tar slip down your throat, but then something seems to suddenly snap into place within your body, like a picture coming into focus.  After that, you don’t feel the need to breathe.

Thinking back to your briefing, you recall what was said about the planet’s ‘ghost matter’.  That so long as you were in contact with it, you would not need to eat or drink, would not even require air.  It seems like that is the case.  It means your lives aren’t about to end… but that’s *all* it means.

The sinking never seems to stop.  You keep falling, down, down down, further and further, feet never reaching a bottom.  Is it a trick of the mind?  Have you fallen into some kind of dimension of infinite sludge?  You have no way of knowing.  The one thing that drives you is the need to keep holding onto your wife, to make sure your bodies never part.  Because if you separated, you’d never find her again in this endlessly churning mire.

At this point, there’s no hope of finding a way out.  But at least you’ll suffer that fact together with the woman you love.

She sees the confidence in your eyes, and does as she is told.  You feel her wrap her arms around your waist, pulling herself in close, nuzzling her face against your shoulder.  It’s a nice feeling, a familiar feeling, and an empowering one too.  Knowing she trusts you enough not to ask questions gives you the self-assurance you need to fight against your own senses.

You close your eyes as well, scooping Revissa up in your arms.  Yes, you easily lift her in the air, as if there weren’t any sticky tar holding you down.  Because, you now realize, there *isn’t* any.  And then you start to walk, one foot in front of the other, ignoring the sounds of the supposed swamp surrounding you and the impossible grip of the tar.  None of this is real.  It’s all just some kind of mental confusion meant to keep you stuck in one place.  For what purpose, you can’t imagine, but it surely isn’t one that’s good for your health.

Navigating purely by belief, disregarding your brain’s perception of reality, you stomp forward, maintaining your momentum until you smack face-first into a tree.  At least it feels like you do, but that might be more diversion.  You keep walking, keep pushing forward, ignoring more attempts to distract you - the heat of flames and smell of smoke, the shuddering footsteps and hungry snarl of a vicious beast, the pleasant smell of perfume and coquettish giggle of a beautiful forest nymph, all of it.  Until, finally, the illusions stop.

You collapse to the ground in a heap with your wife, finally peeling open your eyes to find yourself in an entirely unassuming portion of the woods.  No tar pit, no fire, no monsters, and no lusty dryads (sadly).  It seems like you’ve escaped the lair of whatever creature was trying to trap you in its mental projections.  You never actually managed to lay eyes on it… but maybe that’s for the best.

Pulling out the map on your comm device, you find you’re halfway between your starting location and your destination.  At this point, you’re probably safe to keep heading forwards… but maybe it would be best to double back.  There’s no telling if the creature might try to trap you once more.

(set: $swampescape to true)
After a few minutes of walking, letting your wife lead you, the two of you come to a stop, and she lets you know you can open your eyes again by brushing a hand against your cheek lightly.  

“What the heck was that?” you ask.  “What magic did you use to get us out of that swamp?”

“The swamp… was never there in the first place,” your wife explains.  “As we were sinking, I was reminded of something.  During my time in the Bolg Resistance, some guerrillas that specialized in deep forest missions would report getting lost - even in locations they should have known like the back of their hands.  It turned out there was some kind of predator that sent out a sort of … psychic pulse that confused their pathfinding skills and led them into traps.  I think that’s what was happening here.  According to their stories, the predator would try to incapacitate them in some way - usually by making them believe something that wasn’t true, like that they had fallen into a ravine and broken their leg.  The ones who bought the lie were never heard from again, but those who got out of it did so by noticing the inconsistencies about the situation and fighting against their own senses to escape.”

You scratch your head.  “You figured that out just from the words the fae woman said?  About not trusting your senses.”

“Well… more than that.  It’s when you tried to sacrifice yourself to save me that I felt it.  There was a brief moment where all I could think of was how much I loved you, and… in that instant, I suddenly felt like the tar was gone, that I could move normally.”

A blush creeps across your cheeks, but you mask the emotional moment with your usual confident swagger.  “So basically, it’s all thanks to me.”

Revissa kicks you in the shin with annoyance.  “Yeah, sure, completely negate the fact that I remembered something I heard offhand almost two decades ago that let me drag your blonde ass out of an inescapable situation.”

It’s these moments of banter that remind you why you love her so much.  You just respond by taking her hand and pulling her in for a long, passionate kiss.  As always, that smooths things over nicely.

“As always, you’re my light in the darkness,” you say as you pull away from her.  “Now, let’s get the hell out of here.”

Thanks to Revissa’s quick thinking, another perilous situation has been avoided.  First conniving fae, now strange psychic predators.  At this point, maybe it’s time to admit that you chose wrong when you first entered the forest.  Perhaps a different path would be more accommodating to your efforts.  Though you’ve already wasted enough time already.  After discussing it with your wife, she’s happy to leave the decision in your hands.

Any help they offer will only come back to bite you in the ass later.  But as the sticky mire pulls you up to the neck, you can’t accept this is as your fate.

So with an apologetic glance at your wife, you call out once again.

“Whoever you are, wherever you are, I’m sure you’re watching.  So… please, save us!  Get us out of here, and I’ll play whatever game you want from me.”

Despite your plea, you get no reply, other than the snapping and popping of bubbles, the relentless churning of the bottomless, goopy sludge.  Another tug and you sink up to your chin.  And with another, your nose drops below the surface.  The last thing you can do is make desperate eye contact with your wife before, with one final pull, your world becomes dark.  No more sky, no more trees, no more air, just an endlessly gyrating morass that subsumes all your senses.  

So this is it.  This is how your story ends - sunken and forgotten at the bottom of a tar pit in the middle of a cursed forest.  Not how you expected things to go, that’s for sure.  But then, just as gravity loses all meaning, as up and down become indistinguishable from left and right, something gives way, and you feel yourself landing on soft grass.  Your eyes shoot open and your lungs hungrily gulp down fresh air as you find yourself in the center of a very familiar clearing.

“So… you said you’d play a game with me?”

Presumably, you find sleep, though with no other stimuli to keep you occupied, you’re not even sure when you’re awake and when you aren’t.  But Revissa remains a constant, the pressure of her body the one comfort you have in this endless nightmare.

For the first few days?  Weeks?  Years?  You’re not sure, but for a period of time, you hold on to a hope that someone will find you.  Your friends and crewmates would come looking for you, would try to figure out what had happened.  But for all you know, they get caught by something else.  Hell, they could have fallen into the same infinite sludge pit, could be sinking only inches away from the two of you, and you’d never know it.  Because there’s no way to communicate here - other than with the periodic pressure you and Revissa apply to each other’s bodies with your embrace.  So maybe if you reached out, you’d bump up against Vhaja, or Krysta, or someone else entirely.  There’s no way to know, and you’re not going to risk it.   Because at this point, Revissa is your whole world, is your only comfort, and you’re never going to let her go.  

In the end, eternity passes without a rescue.  But at least you never let go.  At least you’re not alone.  Despite your failure, that’s one small victory.

But thankfully, this is a nightmare you eventually wake up from.  You remain ignorant of the fact you’re being rescued right up until you aren’t, when you suddenly find yourself suspended high in the air, together with various bits of rocks, leaves, and small woodland creatures.

You find out later that your friends managed to track you down thanks to the Star Scout homing beacon, but when they tried to mount a rescue, they could not pick their way through the forest.  So… they flew your spaceship above the location of your beacon and activated its tractor beam, dragging you and half a city block’s worth of forest into the cargo bay.

Curiously, there was no tar found in the hold, or on your bodies.  Was it all some kind of dream?  A hallucination?  You aren’t sure.  The one thing that you do know is that the rescue attempt destroyed your data collection devices, making the mission a resounding failure.  And so you are forced to leave the planet with your tail between your legs, wondering how things might have gone differently if you’d had a better sense of direction.

And so, once you get your bearings straight, you begin to walk.  This time, it appears there’s nothing tripping you up, allowing you to make good time towards your destination.  You feel vindicated that your initial impression about the route was correct - this really was the shortest path, and you really could navigate through it, so long as nothing supernatural got in your way.  

Speaking of supernatural, just as you start to think you’re going to finish the journey uninterrupted, you do, in fact, get interrupted, by a coarse, scraggly voice coming from just past a nearby tree.

“Ho, traveler, stay a while, please, and heed my words,” it says.

You and Revissa stop as the voice addresses you, looking around in confusion for its source.

“Right here, friends.  Beside you.”

It is only then that you realize the voice was not coming from *past* the tree, but from *within* it.  Or rather, coming *from* it.  Because the tree in question appears to have a face carved into its wooden trunk, like one you might see on a jill-o-lantern.  

You blink a few times, glancing at Revissa in confusion, before finally responding.

“Uh… yes?  What can we help you with?”

“Ah, but it is I who I think can help you, travelers,” says the tree.  “These woods are dangerous, as I am sure you already know.  I can guide you to the safest path towards your goal, if you’d like.”


Finally!  Something friendly on this planet, you think to yourself.  You’re about to accept the help when you feel your wife lay a stern hand on your shoulder.

“Something seems wrong…” Revissa says, looking towards you but with eyes darting suspiciously towards the tree.

You raise an eyebrow.   “Aren’t you a nature-lover?  You should be the *first* person in the world to trust what a tree has to say.”

“Yes… but… ugh, I don’t know.  Something just seems wrong to me.  I can’t put my finger on it, but I’m getting bad vibes from this whole thing.”

Well, bad vibes or no, you still have a mission to do.  And after losing several hours to aimless wandering, you really should be getting back to it.

So in a way, maybe you’re actually doing a good job when you turn to Revissa and tell her that it’s best you abandon this path and return to the entrance of the forest.    You were… wrong, to pick this option.  You were wrong when you stubbornly pressed on, when you refused to admit you were lost, and when you decided to turn back and challenge the perception-altering predator that came so close to trapping you.  

In the end, it seems clear that this path cutting through the center of the forest was a mistake.  Better to double back and try a different route entirely.

Revissa seems… frustrated at your indecisiveness, but agrees that she’d really rather not have to contend with all those illusions, or whatever they were, again.  And so she walks alongside you as you retrace your steps, heading back the way you came.  Thankfully, the map on your comm device appears to be accurate, keeping careful note of your reverse-progress as you near the place where you started.  

However, as you are looking down to confirm the readings, you happen to notice the sound of rustling coming from the bushes nearby.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, turn to face it.

If she thinks there’s something fishy here, she’s probably right.  But on the other hand, you can’t just turn down the chance to speed things along, especially after wasting so much time.  Vhaja is counting on you to install these data devices.

“Alright… please show us the way,” you ask to the tree.

Revissa gives you a disapproving look.  You shrug your shoulders apologetically.

“Very well…” says the tree, in its creaking, wooden voice.  “All you need do is follow the sound of my voice.  This portion of the forest can be quite perilous.  Strange monsters roam, waiting to claim unlucky travelers for their own.”

You know that all too well, given your previous encounter with whatever trapped you in that fake swamp.  Escaping that was only possible with boundless confidence, you recall, and so, you maintain that confidence as you unwaveringly accept the tree’s advice.  Revissa rolls her eyes at you, but you maintain a bounce in your step as you head out into the forest once again.  It helpfully warns you when there is danger nearby, speaking of a nest of territorial spiders, of a prowling basilisk, and of a sap-spitting plant that would have loved to wrap you up in its leaves. Before long, you find yourself entering the very deepest part of the woods, a short distance from your destination.

The mission is obviously important, but *because* it’s important you need to avoid walking yourself into any traps that might trip you up.

And that’s when you realize it.  Who’s to say this isn’t yet another, even more elaborate lure from the predator you had escaped earlier?  You’d thought you’d moved past the radius of its influence, but perhaps its reach extends further than you thought.  Or maybe this is another one of its kind, or any of a million other possibilities.  At this point truth and fiction have become so blurred, you’re not sure if *anything* can be trusted.  Other than Revissa.

“Let’s go,” you say, taking her hand and leading her away.  “You’re right, this is probably just another trick.”

She pauses a moment, then nods, allowing you to guide her.  Like before, she closes her eyes and leaves everything to you.

“Wait – no, come back!” yells the tree.  “I promise I’m not the critter who was trying to catch you before.  I can help you, really!  I’m –”

But the tree’s voice has already faded away as you cut through the woods.

Once you’ve put enough distance between you, you check your map once again, and find you’re nearly at your destination.  Though now you’re wondering if this is yet more misdirection.  Maybe you only *think* you’re not lost… is there any way to tell for sure?

It is as you are so deep in thought that you hear a rustle come from the bushes beside you.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, start to turn to face it.

Revissa glances up at the spot, just in time to spy the string of spider silk arcing out from between the branches.  It strikes you right in the chest, glomming on tightly, then pulls backwards, lifting you off your feet and high into the air.  The world becomes a blur, your mind unable to keep up with the suddenness of your abduction, leaving you disoriented well before your body slams into the side of a tree.

And then your attacker is upon you.  By the time you manage to get a glimpse of her face, she’s already pinned you beneath her body and bound your wrists and ankles together to prevent any attempt at struggle.

And then your world becomes as a blur as you spin round and round in her grip, unable to put up a fight as she weaves a taut, inescapable cocoon around your helpless form.  

If nothing else, you have to marvel at her efficiency.  From alert and aware to overwhelmingly helpless in less than a minute flat - a new record, as far as kidnappings go.  And that does seem to be her plan.  Once she’s done bundling you up, she scoops you into her arms and slings you over a shoulder, using lines of webbing to sling herself between the trees and off towards the line of cliffs to the west that ring the forest area.  

You make some token wiggles and squirms, grunting into your gag, but she holds on with a vice-like grip, preventing you from even the most rudimentary hope of escape.  Before long, she has reached her destination, ducking into a cave opening hidden in the cliffs with her new prize in tow.

Given everything else that’s happened so far, you’re pleased to find that the trip into the grove is uneventful.  Your holographic map narrows down the location to an area only a few feet wide, which you reach without incident.  The data device syncs with your comm and begins to hum as you get close, letting you know it is time to remove it from your pack and set it down on the ground.  It sends out a scanner pulse then starts to hover in the air, before turning itself intangible as it aligns with the spectral frequencies of the ambient environment (not that any of those words mean much to you).

And just like that, you’ve completed one of your objectives!  Getting here was certainly not a walk in the park, but happily the actual task proved to be relatively simple.  If only all your jobs could be this easy!

Too late do you realize the error in thinking such a thing.  After all the adventures you’d been on in your life, you should know better than to think anything would ever be easy.  If something is seeming to go smoothly, it just means you are moments away from a complication that will throw everything up now out of balance.

Luckily, the complication this time is quite easy on the eyes.

Revissa’s keen awareness picks up on it first - a change in the texture of the air, a nervousness in the minds of nearby prey animals, a flicker of shadow from a nearby cliff face.  A word of warning from your partner sets you on edge, and your own keen eyes pick out the threat just as it skitters down in front of you, maybe fifty feet away from where you’re standing.

Thick, wavy black hair.  Light, reddish skin, dotted with scale-like clumps of chitinous plating.  A curvaceous body, an amazing figure, two arms, two legs, and eight spider-like appendages protruding from her back.  Four of them are long and sturdy, probably used for mobility, while the other four end in sharp, scythe-like points - probably useful as weapons, or as a tool to peel off the clothing of a victim.  Her eyes gleam with a predator’s intensity, fixed squarely on the two of you.  As if she’s just encountered two lovely flies who have wandered into the spider’s parlour.

You gulp loudly.

“Did you wish this lady into existence?” Revissa says with a sigh.  Her body tenses, her fingers tighten around her staff, and her breathing steadies as she readies herself for a fight.

Instead of looking towards it, you pull her in close, locking eyes only with her.  Beside you, you hear more rustling, the scraping of feet on dirt, a low growl, but you ignore it.

“Let’s keep going,” you say, pressing your forehead against hers.  “We can’t afford to be distracted.”

The growling grows louder, more urgent, the footsteps get closer, but you don’t let them scare you.  With a nod, Revissa closes her eyes once more, and lets you again take her hand.  Together, you flee from the sound, keeping your heads down, blotting out anything other than the sound of your own breathing, of each other’s pressure on your skin.  Whatever creature was threatening you - if it was even real to begin with - doesn’t seem able to keep up with you.

You only stop when your comm device lets out a small beep, informing you that you’re very near to your destination.  The two of you pause, catch your breath, and look around, finding yourselves at the deepest part of the woods.  It looks like you’ve made it!

Whatever creature was threatening you - if it was even real to begin with - doesn’t seem able to keep up with you.

Eventually, you emerge, breathlessly, at the clearing in the forest where you first entered. It seems you’ve made it back, none the worse for wear - other than having wasted several hours making it here.  For all your effort, it seems now you just have to pick another path to reach your destination.

[[Choose a path-&gt;FA06]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="141" name="FD09C" tags="" position="2950,2225" size="100,100">The more you think about it, the more you come to the same conclusion.  Despite all your success thus far in this portion of the woods, the lack of a reliable readout from your map has been a consistent thorn in your side.  Sure, you could keep trying to make progress with brute force, but that’s landed you into peril multiple times already.  Better to cut your losses and try something else.

It’s not the bravest decision, but it’s the most responsible one.  At least, that’s what you tell yourself as you turn around and head back the way you came.  Thankfully, the further you get from the thick tangle of trees, the more responsive your map becomes at updating your position, and soon you find yourself on track to return to the place where you started your forest adventure.

However, as you walk with your nose buried in the holographic navigation display, your ears happen to pick up a sound - a rustling from the bushes nearby.  Revissa hears it too.  You and she exchange glances, and then, as one, you turn to face it.

Be it through strength, wisdom, dedication, or just plain luck, you’ve managed to overcome everything that’s come your way thus far.  So what’s a bit more?

Sure, the forest has been trying to trip you up, lead you astray, divert your attention, but now you’ve learned much more about it.  And so you’re not going to let it scare you from continuing.  With newfound courage, you press forward, heading in the direction you think you need to go without paying too much attention to the map, or even to your own senses.  Eyes and ears can be fooled, but not the heart.  Or at least, so you hope.

Against all odds, you appear to be right.  Now that you know what it was that was getting you lost, you find yourself able to compensate, navigating the treacherous tangle of trees until you make it far enough that your comm device starts working again, having escaped the influence of whatever was fooling your senses.

But even as you are preoccupied with that minor victory,  you hear it - the telltale rustling of bushes off to your side.  Revissa notices it as well, and as one, the two of you turn to face it.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="FD03A" tags="" position="2025,1175" size="100,100">“So once they realized what was happening, what did the resistance members do to avoid the predator?” you ask.

“Well, the way it worked was, once they were lost and separated from their friends, the predator would try to incapacitate them in some way - usually by making them believe something that wasn’t true, like that they had fallen into a ravine and broken their leg.  After that, well - we don’t know what happened to people who it dragged off, but from people that survived, they got out of it by noticing the inconsistencies about the situation and fighting against their own senses to escape.”

You puff your chest out proudly.  “So basically, what I need to do is be even *more* confident that I’m right, and ignore any information to the contrary, even from my own senses.”

“I mean… yeah.  I guess?” Revissa says lamely.  “But I feel like you’re learning the wrong lesson here.”

“Nope!  The solution is to be an intolerable ass and never listen to anyone else.”

Revissa rolls her eyes and kicks you hard in the shin.  You just flash her your most winning smile as you turn around and again head into the center of the forest.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="FD03B" tags="" position="2175,1175" size="100,100">You’re done with this stupid section of forest.  One can only get lost and disoriented so many times before deciding to try a different path.  

“Let’s just head back.  We’ve wasted too much time already.”

Revissa seems disappointed that you’re not interested in making use of her idea, but knows better than to start an argument over it.  And so, you begin tromping back through the forest, thankfully finding no further directional mishaps along the way.  Before long, you can see the edge of the trees in front of you, indicating you’ve fully doubled back after hours of delay.

Now all you need to do is get your bearings once more, and then you can try out a different road.  However, as you are cross-referencing your position with the map on your comm, you happen to notice the sound of rustling coming from the bushes nearby.  Revissa, standing beside you, hears it too.  The two of you exchange glances and then, as one, turn to face it.

[[Lay your eyes on the threat-&gt;FA05]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="FD04A" tags="" position="2225,1400" size="100,100">Your eyes sag as Revissa does her nature thing.  The tree doesn’t seem to speak back to her in any way you can comprehend, but your wife still seems to be making sense of things nonetheless, perhaps noticing the patterns of grass swaying in the breeze, or the motion of leaves as they gently drift down from the branches above.  It’s all rather… boring, if you’re being honest.  Impressive, to be sure - you’ve never had a knack for magic, arcane, animistic, or otherwise, so you’re sure everything Revissa is doing takes concentration and talent.  But it doesn’t change the fact that it’s not particularly engrossing to watch.

Which is why your eyes mostly just drift towards Revissa’s shapely posterior, and the adorable little deer tail poking out from beneath her skirt.  Back and forth, back and forth, it flicks charmingly as she communes.  Though… after a short while, it suddenly holds perfectly still and tense.

Raising an eyebrow in confusion, you look towards your wife’s face, and see telltale signs of worry etched into her features.  Not necessarily scared, but… cautious.  

“Something wrong?” you ask.

It takes a few long moments before she responds.

“I… am not talking to a tree,” she eventually says.

You just kind of stare at her with a confused look on her face.  She sighs irritably.

“It’s… oh, you wouldn’t understand.  But it’s not how a tree would normally talk.”  She turns and glares at the face in the bark.  “It is… some kind of fey spirit, I have to assume.  A trickster, playing a bit of a joke.  Making me think it’s a tree as a jape.”

Now the caution in her posture makes sense.  You haven’t really had much dealing with the fair folk - not exactly your department.  Vhaja has before, you know, together with an unlikely companion she had made, the half-fey daughter of the Winter Queen.  And you’re pretty sure Revissa has spoken about making deals with fairykind during her days in the Bolg Resistance.  But you’ve been fortunate enough to avoid that realm up until now, though even you know that fae are fickle, capricious, and potentially very dangerous

“How delightfully droll,” comes a voice.  It’s sharp and gravely, and appears to be emanating from the ‘mouth’ of the tree-face.  “Figured it out so soon, did you?”

Revissa narrows her eyes.  “I’m not so easily tricked, I’m sorry to say.”

Suddenly, there is a rush of sound, like sparkling firecrackers popping all around you, then a flash of motion as the leaves behind Revissa’s feet swirl in a multi-colored vortex.  You back away instinctively, reaching towards your sword, watching as a figure emerges from the storm and claps its hands.

A figure that… is oddly familiar.

(set: $picF16 to true)

You recognize the gorgeous woman standing in front of you now.  In fact, you were just thinking about her.  Skadi, the Winter Witch, the half-fae princess that Vhaja sometimes works with.  But… that’s impossible, isn’t it?

“The form she is showing is not her true one!” Revissa warns.  “She… must be gazing into our memories to construct an image for herself.”

The woman who is not Skadi smiles and runs a finger playfully along Revissa’s arm.

“And why would you say something like that, my little dear?  Or should I say deer?  Ho, how clever I can be!”

“Because… to me, you look like Un-Rama, the great Guardian Moth, and I know you are not her.”

The fey entity throws up her arms.  “Guilty as charged!  But what’s a little illusion between friends, no?  Because… we *are* friends… right?”

“That remains to be seen,” Revissa murmurs.

“Well, for your sake I hope we are friends.  Because you two are lost, and I know the way home.”

Suddenly, things start to make sense.  Hah!  So it wasn’t that you were reading the map poorly.  It’s that a trickster spirit was manipulating the terrain around you to make sure you ended up losing your way.

There is a pop and not-Skadi is behind you, gently stroking the fluff inside your left ear.

“No, my lost little doggie, you got yourself lost all on your own.  Though once you *were* lost… I might have bent things around a bit to make sure you stayed that way.”

“Why?!” Revissa demands.

“Because that way, I can make sure you play my game!”

You feel a shiver run down your spine… despite the warm (and not entirely unwelcome) presence of not-Skadi’s bosom compressed against your back.  It seems like things have just become very… interesting.

And then her voice cuts off, because, suddenly, the scarf around her neck expands and bubbles out, forming a sort of balloon that has entirely encased her head.  No sound seems able to escape from the odd container, nor does light seem to be able to pass through it, as evidenced by your wife’s aimless flailing.  

“There, much better,” not-|hidden&gt;[(link: &quot;Skadi&quot;)[(go-to: &quot;MX08&quot;)
]] coos.  “A bit of a nag, isn’t she?  Though I suppose all wives are.”

Her voice is all levity, but you’re not laughing.  Though you know better to react aggressively.  You get the sense this woman, whatever she is, is quite powerful, and that any attempt at direct confrontation would end poorly for you.

“What do you want with us?” you eventually say.

“Just to have fun!  Is that such a crime?”

You watch as |hidden&gt;[(link: &quot;Revissa&quot;)[(go-to: &quot;MX06&quot;)
]] blindly stumbles over a tree root and falls to the ground.

“No offense… but I’m pretty sure anything you do for fun is going to be happening at our expense.”

The fae woman sighs dramatically and falls backwards into your arms.  “Ugh, this is the problem with experienced adventurers.  Always so suspicious.”

She disappears in a puff, and then reappears sitting on a tree branch above you.

“So, fine, how about this, |hidden&gt;[(link: &quot;Melfy&quot;)[(go-to: &quot;MX07&quot;)
]] my girl?  Just to show you I’m on the up-and-up.  I’ll help you out of the jam you’re in, free of charge!  You’re lost right now, and all you need to do is say the word and I’ll get you figured out.  How’s that sound?”

It isn’t lost on you that you have never told her your name, but she knows it anyway.  Isn’t a fae knowing your name supposed to be super dangerous?  You glance nervously towards |hidden&gt;[(link: &quot;Revissa&quot;)[(go-to: &quot;MX06&quot;)
]]. Surely she’d tell you not to trust anything this woman says.  But if she really is as powerful as it seems like she is, maybe you can get on her good side by going along with her nonsense.

“Well, what’s it going to be, wolfie?” she asks, holding out her hands.  Cartoon-like word bubbles appear on either side of her, filling out as she speaks the choices.




|leftdialogue&gt;[[[Let me get you figured out?-&gt;FD04C]]]

“Go ahead and click whichever one you like best!”
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="FD04C" tags="" position="2375,1550" size="100,100">You sigh deeply, but eventually relent.

“Fine, you can help me,” you tell the grinning fae, pointing to the word bubble on her left.

The woman claps her hands brightly.  “Wonderful!  But, just to confirm - you want me to help you get figured out, right?”

“Okay, fine!” you say, throwing up your hands.  “Figure us out!”

A mischievous grin forms on not-Skadi’s lips as she snaps her fingers loudly enough to cause an echo between the trees.  “Granted!”

And that’s when you realize you screwed up.  Because all of a sudden, the forest surrounding you starts to grow, the branches of trees stretching away from you higher and higher.  Or… wait, maybe they’re not growing.  Maybe it’s *you* who is shrinking!

“Wha– what are you doing?” you ask in bewilderment, soon growing too small for your clothes to stay fixed on your body.  

“Exactly what you asked for!” is the only reply you get.

By the time it’s done, you’re standing maybe six inches high, and need to burrow your way out of the mountainous pile of clothing you’ve become buried in.  By the time you escape, you find an equally tiny Revissa waiting for you with a scowl on her face.

“Never agree to anything a fae offers you!” she shrieks.

“I just thought–”

“Don’t think, don’t try to outsmart them, don’t play along.  The best thing you can do is ignore them.  Come on, Melfy, we’ve been over this before!”

You scratch your head.  “We have?”

“Yes!  On multiple occasions, but you never list— wah!”

Your argument is cut off as two giant hands descend from the air, plucking each of your tiny bodies up by squeezing you tightly around the waist.  Suddenly you have ascended to dizzying heights, as you and your wife are held at eye level to the relatively giant fae woman.

“Aww… don’t fight, you two.  You make such a cute couple when you’re getting along.  In fact…”

Her eyes begin to glow with a bewitching power, and you feel your fear and irritation fading away.  Revissa’s scowl turns into a placid smile as well, both of you staring at each other with slack-jawed expressions.

“Much better.  Now why don’t the two of you show off how much you love each other?  Won’t that be more fun than yelling and fighting?”

It does sound much more fun.  You hate it when Revissa is mad at you, especially when you know she’s totally justified in feeling that way.  So you’re only too happy to agree to the perfectly reasonable request given to you by the mischievous fae.

Once she seems satisfied you’re both back on good turns, she carries your minimized bodies over to a nearby tree stump, where a small, round platform is waiting.  Beckoning, even.  It’s a strange feeling, but you become overwhelmed with the idea that this little platform is where you belong.  And though it’s only a few inches in diameter, it’s the perfect size to fit a wolf and deer who are eager to make up after a fight.

“Shall we?” you say, motioning to the pedestal.

Revissa nods, and allows you to take her by the hand as you step on top of it together.  The two of you spin around, pressing against each other back to back, linking hands as you turn your heads to smile at the fae woman towering above you.  Ready for whatever comes next.

“Perfect,” she says, as she snaps her fingers one more time.

[[Get figured out-&gt;FD04D]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="FD04E" tags="" position="2375,1675" size="100,100">You roll your eyes as you point to the word bubble on the right.

“No offense, but I’m pretty sure I’m not supposed to agree to anything a fae offers to me,” you say.  Your tone of voice is sincerely apologetic.  “Maybe you’d actually help, maybe you wouldn’t, but my wife would be upset with me if I actually went along with it.”

Rather than be upset, the fae woman simply claps her hands in amusement.

“What a dedicated spouse you are.  I’m impressed!”

You raise an eyebrow.  “You are?”

“It’s rare to find true love nowadays.  Yet you and your friends all seem to have it.”

That causes your eyebrow to raise even further.  “My friends?  You mean Krysta and Vhaja and the rest?”

“I’ve got my eye on all of you,” the fae woman says in a tone of voice that sounds chipper but has an ominous ring behind it.  “And I’m eager to see how all of you handle what lies ahead.”

You raise a hand to interject, but before a word gets out, the woman is gone.  Behind you, Revissa growls in annoyance as she finally gets the scarf off of her head.  She looks around quickly then runs over to you in a huff.  You give her the run-down of the exchange as best you can.

“Good.  Never trust a fae,” she says firmly.  “Never accept any of their deals.  Any help they give always comes at a cost too high to pay.”

It feels good that you’ve finally done something smart for once.  Though… it doesn’t solve the fact that you’re still lost…

It figures this would happen to you.  With a snap of her finger, the powerful fae trickster has transformed you and your wife into glossy plastic collectibles, mounted on top of a circular display stand.  Now your bodies are smooth and hard, sculpted action figures expertly crafted down to the finest detail.

Or would that be ‘in’action figures?

You’re both unable to move, of course.  Unable to speak.  Unable to complain as you’re bundled up into a nice little box and delivered to a curio shop that seems to exist outside of time and space.  You’re not the only items on display here - the place is full of various knick-knacks and antiques.  On one wall, a giant grandmother clock.  Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.  Behind the glass of the clock, a tsunojian is shackled in place, the pendulum tick-tocking between her two heaving breasts.  And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.  And the basin of the birdbath, of course, is clutched between the fingers of a petrified elvaan, the placid smile etched onto her face belying the terror she must have felt in the moment her fate was sealed.

As for the two of you, you’re placed at the corner of the reception desk at the front of the store.  Though the place rarely seems to get any customers.  Despite its appearance, this is not a place of business but a prison, housing the helpless souls of all the women the fae has decided to collect.  You and Revissa are two among many, doomed to maintain the same pose and glassy-eyed expressions for the rest of your days.

“Oh-ho… yes, I could show you the way…” says the tree.  “No trouble at all.  A fair trade for revitalizing these old roots of mine with your show.”

Well, at least something good has come from your mistake earlier with the pollen.  You’re about to agree to the trade, but then you get a soft elbow to the side from your wife.  With a sigh, you turn to her to see what the issue is.

“Something seems wrong…” Revissa says, looking towards you but with eyes darting suspiciously towards the tree.

“Weren’t *you* the one who wanted to ask the plants for help?”

“Yes… but… ugh, I don’t know.  Something just seems wrong to me.  I can’t put my finger on it, but I’m getting bad vibes from this whole thing.”

Well, bad vibes or no, you still have a mission to do.  And after losing several hours to aimless wandering and intense lovemaking, you really should be getting back to it.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="153" name="FD05B" tags="" position="2300,1950" size="100,100">On the one hand, you trust Revissa’s instincts implicitly.  If she thinks there’s something fishy here, she’s probably right.  But on the other hand, you can’t just turn down the opportunity to get things back on track.  Vhaja is counting on you to install these data devices.

“Alright… please show us the way,” you ask to the tree.

Revissa gives you a disapproving look.  You shrug your shoulders apologetically.

“Very well…” says the tree, in its creaking, wooden voice.  “All you need do is follow the sound of my voice.  This portion of the forest can be quite confusing.  Your senses cannot always be relied upon.  But my voice will ring true, and serve as a beacon.”

So there *was* something unnatural about the forest!  No wonder you were getting lost.  You puff out your chest proudly.  If you hadn’t triggered that pollen, the two of you wouldn’t have gotten frisky, and the tree wouldn’t have been there to get you out of this mess.  Sometimes the correct choice is to make a bunch of mistakes and get lucky right at the end.

Revissa rolls her eyes at you, but you maintain a bounce in your step as you head out into the woods once again.  As promised, the helpful tree guides you along the path, helping you overcome the otherwise distracting and disorienting twists and turns of this portion of the forest.  And eventually, you get far enough away from whatever the disturbance was that the map on your comm device seems to be working again, allowing you to navigate the rest of the way with your own skills.  Before long, you find yourself entering the very deepest part of the woods, a short distance from your destination.

[[Head inside-&gt;FE01]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="154" name="FD05C" tags="" position="2450,1950" size="100,100">You haven’t gotten as far as you have in life without trusting in Revissa’s instincts.  The mission is obviously important, but *because* it’s important you need to avoid walking yourself into any traps that might trip you up.

“Look,” you say to the tree.  “I get you’re offering to help, but you’ve gotta see this from our perspective.  We’re in unfamiliar territory, and we’ve only just met you.  What proof do we have that you’re not, say, just going to lead us right into the grasp of a sexy spider-babe who’ll web us up and carry us away to her love-making nook?”

Revissa gives you the stink-eye.  You give her a shrug back.  Look, you’re still a bit horny, so you can’t be blamed if your thoughts are leaning towards the fetishistic. 

A low, raspy, grating laugh creaks out from the tree’s ‘mouth’.  It’s the sound of wood on wood, a disorienting scraping noise that doesn’t sound the least bit mirthful.

“You haven’t been reading ahead, have you?” says the tree.  “Picking the obvious Bad End path to get your jollies on before doubling back to try and actually win?”

You raise your eyebrow in confusion.  You’re not really sure what the tree is saying… but also it almost feels like it&#39;s talking to someone else other than you.  But who could that be?  It’s not like there’s anyone here but yourself and Revissa.

But as you spare your wife a glance, you notice she has become even more tense than earlier.  She narrows her eyes as she looks at the face etched into the wood in front of you.

“We… are not talking to a tree,” she eventually says.  “It is… some kind of fey spirit, I have to assume.  A trickster, playing a bit of a joke.  Making us think it’s a tree as a jape.”

Now the caution in her posture makes sense.  You haven’t really had much dealing with the fair folk - not exactly your department.  Vhaja has before, you know, together with an unlikely companion she had made, the half-fey daughter of the Winter Queen.  And you’re pretty sure Revissa has spoken about making deals with fairykind during her days in the Bolg Resistance.  But you’ve been fortunate enough to avoid that realm up until now, though even you know that fae are fickle, capricious, and potentially very dangerous

“How delightfully droll,” comes a voice.  It’s warm and soft and playful, the polar opposite of the sounds that had been emanating from the ‘mouth’ of the tree-face.  “Figured it out so soon, did you?”

Suddenly, there is a rush of sound, like sparkling firecrackers popping all around you, then a flash of motion as the leaves behind Revissa’s feet swirl in a multi-colored vortex.  You back away instinctively, reaching towards your sword, watching as a figure emerges from the storm and claps its hands.

A figure that… is oddly familiar.

You recognize the gorgeous woman standing in front of you now.  In fact, you were just thinking about her.  Skadi, the Winter Witch, the half-fae princess that Vhaja sometimes works with.  But… that’s impossible, isn’t it?

“The form she is showing is not her true one!” Revissa warns.  “She… must be gazing into our memories to construct an image for herself.”

The woman who is not Skadi smiles and runs a finger playfully along Revissa’s arm.

“And why would you say something like that, my little dear?  Or should I say deer?  Ho, how clever I can be!”

“Because… to me, you look like Un-Rama, the great Guardian Moth, and I know you are not her.”

The fey entity throws up her arms.  “Guilty as charged!  But what’s a little illusion between friends, no?  Because… we *are* friends… right?”

“That remains to be seen,” Revissa murmurs.

“Well, for your sake I hope we are friends.  Because you two are lost, and I know the way home.”

Suddenly, things start to make sense.  Hah!  So it wasn’t that you were reading the map poorly.  It’s that a trickster spirit was manipulating the terrain around you to make sure you ended up losing your way.

There is a pop and not-Skadi is behind you, gently stroking the fluff inside your left ear.

“No, my lost little doggie, you got yourself lost all on your own.  Though once you *were* lost… I might have bent things around a bit to make sure you stayed that way.”

“Why?!” Revissa demands.

“Because that way, I can make sure you play my game!”

You feel a shiver run down your spine… despite the warm (and not entirely unwelcome) presence of not-Skadi’s bosom compressed against your back.  It seems like things have just become very… interesting.  

[[Find out exactly how interesting-&gt;FD05D]]
]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="155" name="FD05D" tags="" position="2425,2100" size="100,100">“What kind of game?” you ask suspiciously.

Revissa kicks you in the shin.  “No, don’t even think about playing along.  Don’t interact, don’t entertain.  Never indulge the whims of a fae, or they’ll just take it as an invitation to keep on bothering you.”

“But don’t you worship Un-Rama?” you ask.  “She’s a fae spirit.”

“She’s different!  Un-Rama is a guardian and protector.  But this woman… is a trickster.  I can tell just by looking at her.  She wants nothing more than to lead us into a trap for her own entertainment.”

“You wound me!” not-Skadi says, miming being shot through the heart and falling backwards.  “And if I wasn’t in such a good mood after watching you two have sex, I’d probably turn you into a frog or something.  Which I *could* do, you know.  You wouldn’t have any defense against it.  Like it or not, I’m much more powerful than either of you, so really it’s in your best interest to entertain me.”

You step forward.  “Alright… let’s say I did want to entertain you.  What’s so special about us that someone as powerful as you has taken an interest?”

“Oh, it’s not the *us* so much as the *you*, my darling wolfie.  Or actually, your crew.  The Rabbit’s Foot Guild!  Erm, sorry, wrong universe.  The Rabbit’s Foot *Company*, as your merry little band of mercs is called.  Right?  You’re kind of a big deal.  Some might say the biggest deal in this universe.”

Okay, now you know she’s pulling your leg.  “Big deal?  I mean, sure, we had some adventures.  Maybe even helped save the galaxy once or twice.  But we’re still less famous than the knock-off cartoon series Icewing made based on us”

The fae woman giggles.  “Ooh, I love you throwing in a reference to the campaign that casual readers wouldn’t recognize.  But no, I don’t mean *in-universe* fame, I mean at the meta level.  The four of you are probably the most famous characters from this neck of the woods - other than the Demon Queen, I guess.”

“By the four of us… you mean me, Krysta, Vhaja, and Lumina?”

She claps her hands.  “Exactly!  Not gonna lie, I’m kind of disappointed you partnered up with the wifey here for the adventure - I prefer classic foursome perils, myself.  Which is why, to be perfectly honest, I don’t care for the deer girl - other than as a supporting character in your life.  So she really shouldn’t get a say in what happens next in our little tete-a-tete.”

Your head is spinning trying to wrap your mind around all of this, but there’s one thing you know for certain.  Despite the occasional butting of heads, you love Revissa with all your heart.  So you’re not going to just let her be sidelined in this discussion.  Instead you’re going to–

The fae woman snaps her fingers… and then Revissa is gone.  Not teleported, not carried away.  Like the frame containing her in the film reel was severed completely.

“I’m serious about this,” the woman says, pressing herself up against you.  “You’re the main character here, not her.  That’s why all the big important, plot-branching decisions always hinge on *your* choices.  I mean, seriously, have you noticed that some of the artwork is using older versions of her design?  Big pointy ears, no horns, that kind of stuff?  What shamelessly lazy production values.  Just commission new art if she’s so important, right?”

You’re not sure if you want to feel terrified or furious at this woman.  Or, to be fair, aroused.  She is still incredibly attractive, and her chest is nicely squishing itself against your arm.  But whatever she is, it is abundantly clear that she is far too powerful to confront directly.  And that you very well might need to play her game if you ever want to see your wife again.

“Fine… I guess I have no choice,” you say.  “I’ll play your damn game.  So what is it you want me to do?”

The fae woman throws her hands up into the air theatrically.  “Oh, I thought you’d never ask!”

She snaps her fingers, and a structure appears with a pop in the center of the clearing you’ve been standing in.  It’s some kind of brightly colored, open-air tent, circular in construction with strangely shaped seats arranged around its circumference.

You narrow your eyes.  “What is this?”

“Our game, silly!”

You shake your head.  “Before we play any games, I want you to tell me what you did with Revissa.”

“Oh, but that’s just the thing - she’s already here!”

Her eyes dart towards the tent-like structure.  You follow where they are looking, and, after a moment of shocked revelation, have to stifle a gasp.

(link:&quot;I think she looks cute like this.  Don&#39;t you, $yourname?&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

(set: $picF18 to true)

What you thought was a tent was actually an old-timey mechanized merry-go-round, the kind you might find at a carnival, or at Floofyland™.  But the seats on the ride are all hybridized female figures, half animal, half person.  Revissa, of course, often takes the form of what you lovingly call a deer-taur, a quadrupedal cervid with a humanoid torso.  And she’s taking that form now, but her body is stiff and glossy, with a pole through her midsection and a saddle painted onto her back.  

“Wh… what the hell have you done to her!” you yell, as your arm subconsciously reaches for the sword on your back.

The fae woman chuckles.  &quot;I’ve done to her something I could just as easily could do to you, if I wanted to.  And something I *will* do if your hand gets any closer to that sword.”

She vanishes in a puff of smoke, then reappears right beside you, pressing her bosom against your side.

“Need I remind you, I control her fate.  She’s become a glossy little prop, a background element of your story.  And she’ll stay that way unless you agree to play along.”

Her voice has become frighteningly ominous, and you can’t help but shiver with anxiety.  “Okay… fine.  It’s not like I have a choice.  I’ll play whatever game you have in mind.  But if’s a game, there *are* rules, right?  Rules that you’ll follow?”

“Of course!  I am a woman of my word, after all.  The rules are even quite simple.  We’re going to have a race!  You and I choose a mount, and whichever one makes three laps around the merry-go-round first is the winner!”

You narrow your eyes.  “And if I win, you’ll restore Revissa and let us go?”

“If you win you get a prize,” she says.  “Getting your wife back can be that prize, if you wish.”

This is why Revissa says not to trust the fae.  You can *feel* the way she is arranging her words, deliberately leaving wiggle room in any condition she agrees to.  If you were a smarter woman, you would try to parse where in her statement she might trip you up.  But you’re no lawyer, and you were never particularly good at riddles.  So all you can do is play along and hope your instincts kick in before you fall into one of her semantic traps.  But there is at least one thing you can confirm.

“Alright… so obviously I’m going to pick Revissa.  But I’ll only agree if you play fair.  Whichever mount you choose as your racer has to go at the same speed as Revissa does.”

“Done!” the fae says quickly.  *Too* quickly.  If she’s planning on cheating, clearly altering the speed of the racers isn’t how she’s going to do it.  But you can’t think of any more obvious hacks she could use.  

With no other ideas left, you trundle off to the merry-go-round and plop your butt down on Revissa’s smooth, glossy backside - something that requires a bit of maneuvering, given her long hair braid is stiffly protruding behind her, poking into your arm as you try to settle in.  Clearly this ride wasn’t built for comfort.  You wonder idly if she’s still conscious, if behind that placid smile frozen on her face she’s screaming at you to back out, or trying to tell you about the obvious trick you’re walking right into.  But if there are any words on her mind, they don’t escape her lips. 

All you can do is wrap your arms around her smooth shoulders and hold on, as the ride whirs to life.

Everything had become a blur, and you felt like you were repeating yourself over and over again, trapped in a never-ending loop.  Your head is spinning as you finally bring yourself out of your funk, looking up with bleary eyes towards the fae woman.

“I… what?” you ask weakly.

“Yes, yes, I’m sure you’re quite exhausted, being led around in circles by the invisible hand of some higher power.  But luckily for you, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.  Or rather, a nice piece of plastic packaging.”

Through the fog of memory, you vaguely recall agreeing to something.  But… was that you?  It must have been… and yet, at the same time, it doesn’t add up.  Why would you ask to be–

But then the fae woman snaps her fingers, and the world falls out from under you again.  Everything spins, the scenery shifts, the world melts away… and now you’re somewhere else.  And you’re naked, too.

“Hey, what gives!”

And you’re not alone.  To your surprise, you find Krysta sitting next to you.  

“I… do not… my mind, my thoughts, so muddled…”

Vhaja as well.

“This… is… oof… why do I feel so dizzy…”

Even Lumina.  Just the four of you, you realize.  Revissa is still nowhere in sight.  Nor is Jyumon.  Though your head is throbbing, you remember the fae woman saying something to you… that she didn’t consider your wife a part of the crew.  That she liked things when it was just the four of you.  Is this an extension of that?  Has she kidnapped you all for some sick purpose?

“Whatever is going on… it’s clear we have to get out of here,” you say. 

But where exactly is here?  It appears to be… a factory of some kind?  You see conveyors belts, assembly lines, machinery of unknown make and purpose.  What is this place?  And what had the woman said… something about… packaging?

There is the sudden sound of rumbling movement, mechanisms whirring to life, and then a metal arm clamps down around your waist.  You’re hoisted into the air before you have a chance to resist it, and by the time you regain your bearings you’re already falling.  You land with a thud onto the surface of a conveyor belt, pulled onwards towards the interior of a processing booth of some kind.  You think about trying to roll off the platform, but are distracted from various cries of distress from beneath you.  Looking down, you see the rest of your friends are being ferried around in the same way you were.  But just as you prepare yourself to jump down to help them, more metal arms shoot out and clamp down around your wrists and ankles, dragging you through the mouth of the machine.

Suddenly there is darkness, as you feel yourself being manipulated.  You’re pushed backwards against a solid surface, and feel something jam a gag into your mouth.  A muffled grunt of confusion escapes your bound lips as you try to reach and pull it out, but more metal grabbers snap around your limbs and force them into place.  You feel restraints loop around you, snagging your ankles, your shins and thighs, then your wrists and elbows, around your waist, your neck, even two pressing in against your tail!

Once you’re secured, a blaring light switches on, making you blink in confusion as you see various items getting dragged in next to you.  They seem like bits of leather armor, some pants, a metal breastplate, clothing and equipment that you get the sense could fit your body, and seems oddly familiar… yet which you’re sure you’ve never worn before.  Each item is snapped in place, before a clear plastic barrier is dragged over and fitted over your body, an aperture in its side cut in the perfect shape to snap around your silhouette.

It’s… like you’ve been made up to look like an action figure!  Bound up in place, your clothing and weapon and gear slotted neatly into little holes specifically made to contain them.  What kind of bizarre trap is this?  You wriggle and squirm against the tight bindings, but you are helplessly anchored, unable to find any point of articulation to generate enough force to get free.  You feel a pit form in your stomach as you realize how completely powerless you now are.

Only once the ride starts does it occur to you to ask how, exactly, you’re supposed to have a race on a merry-go-round in the first place.  Isn’t the whole thing literally on rails?  Your opponent doesn’t seem to mind, however, having settled down on the back of a purple bunny-taur seat that seems oddly familiar to you for some reason.

She gives you a wave as the ride starts spinning and… her seat starts pulling ahead of yours after a quarter-turn around the center.

“What the hell?!” you yell, “you agreed we’d go the same speed!”

“Ah, but we are, my deer-riding dear, we are.”

In a panic, you inspect the ride more closely.  The ‘horses’ are arranged in a circle around the circumference of the central pillar in two concentric rings - an inner and an outer one.  Revissa is situated on the one farther from the center, whereas not-Skadi is in the inner circle.  You’re no mathematician, but you still grasp the issue.  Even if both circles are rotating at the same speed, the inner one has less distance to cross, which means it’s going to start pulling ahead in a relative sense once the ride gets going.  A pit forms in your stomach as you realize by demanding both mounts move at the same speed you were actually giving yourself a handicap.  Your opponent notices the change on your face and gives you a wink as she happily sails forward.

If you don’t do something, you’re going to lose!

Perching up on your seat, you spend a moment to calculate your trajectory, then make a diving lunge towards the shapely fae’s body.  To be honest, it’s a fairly desperate ploy - which is why it surprises you when it works.

You feel soft flesh against your skin as you collide with your opponent, knocking her from her perch and slamming her against the central rotating pillar.  Now you have her pinned beneath you, your powerful arms pressed down on her shoulders to prevent her from regaining her position.  And yet… she does not seem the least bit perturbed.

“Oh… so forward.  And here I thought I’d only give you a kiss if you won.”

There’s only time for you to blink in confusion before she leans in against you and warmly locks lips.  And then… your world falls into a pleasant blur.  You have a vague recollection of hands and teeth and exposed nipples on milky white skin, of dark, silken hair swishing against your back, of hands roughly stroking the fur on your ears and tail.  It feels like it lasts for an eternity, and yet, at the same time, that it is over too soon.

What breaks the reverie is the sound of a victory fanfare blaring from the merry-go-round’s tinny speakers, announcing that a winner has crossed the finish line first.  You look at the fae woman in confusion as she lustily strokes the inner fuzz on your ear with a hand.

“Oh, silly girl.  The rule was whose mount crossed first, not which rider.  And since I was ahead when we started, it means I’m still ahead when you’ve finished.”

A wicked smile crosses her lips as she stands up.

“And you *are* finished, my dear.”

And then she snaps her fingers.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="FD06D" tags="" position="2725,1400" size="100,100">As you fumble for solutions, you get the idea that if Revissa were tightly tethered to the bunny-taur with a strong enough rope, she would essentially get pulled along by the ‘faster’ of the two mounts.  But where can you find a sturdy rope on such short notice?  Looking around, your eyes rest on the colorful banners flapping in the breeze on the outside of the ride, which are attached to the ‘tent’ portion with some thin wires.  Maybe those will do the trick!

Careful of the rotation of the ride beneath you, you reach out, grasping hold of a banner and tugging it down.  To your satisfaction, it comes loose easily.  Then as quick as you are able, you tear off the cloth banner to get to the binding beneath it, giving it a pull to test its strength.  It’ll have to do.  You’re no cowgirl, but you manage to form a passable loop from the metal cord, and then swing it over your head, taking careful aim.

When it’s set loose from your grip, you hold your breath, carefully trying to use your wrist to maneuver it into place - and you’re rewarded by a tug as it finds purchase around the bunny-taur’s neck.  Success!

After that, it’s a simple process to tie the cord around Revissa’s own glossy midsection, tethering her and the lead rider together.  You’re soon rewarded by a heavy creak as the line goes taut, forcing the outer circle to rotate faster to keep up with the inner one.  

The fae woman shifts in her seat, delicately twanging the cord with a finger.

“How clever,” she says with a smile.  But she takes no further action to impede your progress.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="164" name="FD06E" tags="" position="2850,1400" size="100,100">Your mind races for solutions to the problem, and eventually settles on a rather extreme one.  If the ride is rigged to ensure Revissa falls behind, then you’ll just have to physically change it so that it doesn’t.  The two rows of ‘horses’ are arranged on separate, concentrically rotating circles, so if you could somehow manage to jam up the one containing the fae woman’s mount then yours would be able to get ahead.

Leaping from Revissa’s smooth, shiny back, you land on the surface of the ride itself, and pull out your sword from its place at your back.  Getting down on all fours, you carefully study the seam between the two rotating circles, finding a spot that looks like it might be vulnerable to tampering.  Then you jam the end of your blade into the gap, trying to dig it down as far as it can go to mess with whatever gears are turning beneath the surface.

You’re rewarded with an ear-splitting screech as metal grinds against metal, and feel a jolt as half the ride grinds to a halt.  The fae woman looks backwards from her position ahead of you, scowling in annoyance.  You give her a winning smile back, prompting her to flick her finger upwards.  Suddenly, your sword rises up into the air and then sails away into the forest, useless to you for the remainder of the race.  The merry-go-round hums back into full operation, chugging along as not-Skadi continues on her merry way.  But at least you gained some ground.

You’ve been taken back to where you first met the beguiling fae, transported so effortlessly you hadn’t even realized you were being moved.  Everything around the clearing looks more or less the same, but now there is a large structure dominating its center.  It’s some kind of brightly colored, open-air tent, circular in construction with strangely shaped seats arranged around its circumference.

“Hopefully it wasn’t too bumpy a ride?” she asks sweetly.

The woman who looks like Skadi sits on a tree stump at the edge of the clearing, crossing and uncrossing her legs alluringly.  Your eyes, unbidden, trace the outline of her thighs, and the way her chest rises and falls with each breath.  Sure, she’s just picking a woman from your memory to present herself as - but that woman is *hot*.  If anything, it would be rude *not* to appreciate the aesthetics, as it were, of the situation.  Though perhaps you appreciate them for a bit too long before you realize that something is missing.

“Wait… where’s Revissa?”

Not-Skadi smiles distantly.

“Oh, she’s here.  Already all set up for our little game.”

Her eyes dart towards the tent-like structure.  You follow where they are looking, and, after a moment of shocked revelation, have to stifle a gasp.

(link:&quot;Honestly, I quite think this is an improvement for her.  Don&#39;t you, $yourname?&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

What you thought was a tent is actually an old-timey mechanized merry-go-round, the kind you might find at a carnival, or at Floofyland™.  But the seats on the ride are all hybridized female figures, half animal, half person.  Revissa, of course, often takes the form of what you lovingly call a deer-taur, a quadrupedal cervid with a humanoid torso.  And she’s taking that form now, but her body is stiff and glossy, with a pole through her midsection and a saddle painted onto her back.  

“Wh… what the hell have you done to her!” you yell.

Your clothing and equipment has all mysteriously returned to your body since the tar pit incident, almost like it was never removed in the first place.  But you have more pressing matters on your mind at the time, as your arm subconsciously reaches for the sword on your back.

The fae woman chuckles.  I’ve done to her something I could just as easily could do to you, if I wanted.  And something I *will* do if your hand gets any closer to that sword.”

She vanishes in a puff of smoke, then reappears right beside you, pressing her bosom against your side.

“Need I remind you, you *agreed* to play my game.  So now you don’t get to protest the rules.”

You let your hand go limp.  “But there *are* rules, right?  Rules that you’ll follow?”

“Of course!  I am a woman of my word, after all.  The rules are even quite simple.  We’re going to have a race!  You and I choose a mount, and whichever one makes three laps around the merry-go-round first is the winner!”

You narrow your eyes.  “And if I win, you’ll restore Revissa and let us go?”

“If you win you get a prize,” she says.  “Getting your wife back can be that prize, if you wish.”

This is why Revissa says not to trust the fae.  You can *feel* the way she is arranging her words, deliberately leaving wiggle room in any condition she agrees to.  If you were a smarter woman, you would try to parse where in her statement she might trip you up.  But you’re no lawyer, and you were never particularly good at riddles.  So all you can do is play along and hope your instincts kick in before you fall into one of her semantic traps.  But there is at least one thing you can confirm.

“Alright… so obviously I’m going to pick Revissa.  But I’ll only agree if you play fair.  Whichever mount you choose as your racer has to go at the same speed as Revissa does.”

“Done!” the fae says quickly.  *Too* quickly.  If she’s planning on cheating, clearly altering the speed of the racers isn’t how she’s going to do it.  But you can’t think of any more obvious hacks she could use.  

With no other ideas left, you trundle off to the merry-go-round and plop your butt down on Revissa’s smooth, glossy backside - something that requires a bit of maneuvering, given her long hair braid is stiffly protruding behind her, poking into your arm as you try to settle in.  Clearly this ride wasn’t built for comfort.  You wonder idly if she’s still conscious, if behind that placid smile frozen on her face she’s screaming at you to back out, or trying to tell you about the obvious trick you’re walking right into.  But if there are any words on her mind, they don’t escape her lips. 

All you can do is wrap your arms around her smooth shoulders and hold on, as the ride whirs to life.

Vhaja comes next, trapped in place with her arms out at her sides.  Oddly, she doesn’t have a gag between her lips, something that would normally be a given for a magic-user - but instead she has little straps around each of her fingers, completely immobilizing her hands, preventing her from making any arcane gesture.

Bringing up the rear is Lumina, her hands bound above her head, her wings spread out and fixed in place like she was a butterfly pinned and mounted to a collector’s display board.  The outfit included in her display stand is the same teal-and-gold color as her normal fare, but looks more like traditional fantasy clerical robes than the tight shinium leotard she usually wears.  She’s been physically gagged as well, a defeated look on her face as she is lowered down beside the rest of you.

“And so, my collection is complete!”

The fae woman appears in a puff of smoke to inspect her new trophies.  All of you are completely helpless, able to do nothing but wiggle and squirm.  Vhaja yells something out, but her voice is muffled by the plastic casing, making her words incomprehensible.  The rest of you, being gagged, make even less sense as you try to voice your complaints at the situation you now find yourselves in.

“So, let’s go over a few details of your situation,” not-Skadi says, walking down the line of her new prizes.  “Firstly, these bindings are all magical in nature.  Totally inescapable, so don’t bother trying - though I never mind watching you squirm.  And, of course, they’ll keep you all hale and hearty for as long as you need to be.  Which brings me to the second detail - yup, this situation is a permanent one.  I’m keeping you all forever, and no one will ever be able to find you.  So go ahead and dash any hopes of rescue from those pretty little heads of yours.  And thirdly - don’t worry, it’s Game Over for your girlfriends, too.  Just because they’re not part of your original crew doesn’t mean I won’t be keeping them forever in my collection.”

A slap on the butt sends her tumbling to the ground, before she’s pulled a short distance to a waiting golden box.  It’s almost coffin-shaped, and is the perfect size to fit her body as the lid is slammed closed and locked with a resounding snap.

“There we are - snug as a bug in a rug.  Or a fox in a box, as it were.  But now we have one more special guest to add to my archive…”

Another snap of her fingers, and another spotlight switches on.  You see Revissa, arms bound behind her back and standing between two long poles, a piece of shiny tape slapped over her lips.  She squirms helplessly in place as a device switches on, two rollers spinning along the poles to begin winding glossy lengths of plastic wrap around her body.]

The machine does not stop until she’s fully mummified, head to toe in the stuff, and a heat lamp runs over her to shrink-wrap the plastic into a full-on lamination.  She can only writhe helplessly, trying to make eye contact with you through the opaque coverings, before more loading arms pick her up, drop her in a metal case, and lock it shut.

“Oh, don’t look so broken up about it!” the fae woman says, walking over to gently jostle your packaging.  “Surely you see what I mean, right?  Her design is all wrong here - no horns, ears the wrong shape, and did you see how some of her face tattoos were lacking an outline?  That’s because the person who drew the lineart forgot them in the sketch, and they were only added when someone else colored it in.  Shameful.”

Behind her, the two cases containing your captive lovers are loaded onto cranes and taken away to parts unknown, leaving the four of you alone with your tormentor.

“Compare that to the four of you - your designs have been remarkably consistent ever since your first conception in that silly dress-up game program.  Sure, hairstyles change up a bit, and sometimes artists forget the splash of brown at the tips of your ears and tail - and, okay, some people don’t draw you with as much muscle as they should –” she says, poking at the packaging around your belly area “-- but overall, your four have really wonderful designs.  Obviously, Krysta being a squirrel is a new thing, but she’s still recognizable - though I’m gonna be honest, I actually prefer her as a human.  It’s a classic, you know?

Your design has always been perfect.”

None of you are able to offer commentary on the woman’s incredibly bizarre and erratic monologue, only able to fruitlessly push against your bindings.

“Anyway… I had my fun, messed around with you all a bit, and in the end decided you were worthwhile additions to my collection.  And so, that’s where you’ll all stay - forever, of course.  Now… let’s find someplace to put you on display…”

You can’t for the life of you imagine why - it’s not like you have any agency at all to influence her mood.  But one day she comes out and says it.  What feels like a lifetime ago, you sucked down a Star Scout homing beacon, and ever since you’ve been captured it’s been sending out pulses into the void.  Useless to attract help, but effective in creating an obnoxious ringing in her ear.  Because the Scouts are formed around the tenets of love and happiness, even her fae magic can’t just undo the signal.  So she just tries to live with it.  But eventually, the benefit of keeping you outweighs the annoyance.

All at once, you and your friends appear in a naked pile in the middle of a remote planet.  No gear, no equipment, no idea how long you’ve been gone, or how you’ll make your way back to civilization.  She doesn’t care - she just wants to put an end to the incessant ringing.  Then she vanishes in her signature puff of smoke, leaving your party to their own devices.

What follows is an exciting adventure in its own right, but it’s not the adventure we’re here to tell today.  And, regardless, your actions have led to failing your original mission.  Maybe next time you’ll think better about getting tangled up with a fae.

GAME OVER

[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="170" name="FD07A" tags="" position="3000,1400" size="100,100">Try as you might, you just couldn’t come out ahead.  Part of you wonders if it was ever possible at all.  

“I must say, you made a good go of it.  I could really feel the intensity and passion as you tried desperately to save your wife.  You must really love her.   I almost feel bad about how I treated your darling little deer - almost.  Ho ho.  But I must say, a tiny bit of guilt is worth it in exchange for the lovely little prize I won for myself today.”

All you can do is glare at the languidly laughing.  Literally.  Because other than your eyes, you can’t move a muscle.  At first, you have no idea why - at least, not until the beguiling villain snaps a finger to produce a mirror in front of you.

(set: $picF33 to true)

You’ve been stripped naked, forcibly posed in an at-attention position with your sword clutched between your hands.  Your feet have become embedded in a large, round platform, holding you in place, and your body has been coated, head to toe, in gleaming silver paint that has hardened atop your bare skin.  The end result is to transform you into the very thing you ‘won’ for your second-place finish - a silver trophy. 

“Now then… we established what would happen if *you* won the race, but we never hammered out the details if *I* won.  But I suppose there’s no time like the present.  So why don’t I propose some options.  If you don’t like them, just say no and we’ll think of something else.”

“....”

With your lips frozen in place, you can’t make a sound, one way or another.  

“So, how about this?  If the game ends with me as the winner, I’ll keep your lovely wife as part of my merry-go-round for the rest of eternity, and you as my lovely little trophy for the same duration.  Neither of you will ever be freed without my express approval, and no one will ever be able to save you.  How does that sound?”

“...!” 

You try to yell out a protest, but the fae woman cannot hear you.

She pokes your nose playfully.  “Just say ‘no I do not accept these terms’ and I’ll come up with something better.  But while we’re pitching ideas… how about I also track down your other friends and add them to my collection as well?  Say something if you disagree.”

“........!”

“You’re sure?  All you need to do is say the words – otherwise I’ll assume you accept my proposal.”

“.......................!”

“Well, if you insist… very well.  The deal is agreed upon.  You and your wife shall now belong to me for the rest of time.  And I’ll go ahead and capture the rest of your merry crew as well!”

A terrible dread sits in to the pit of your stomach as you can somehow *feel* the contract coming into effect.  This is just about the worst outcome imaginable.  You continue trying to catch her attention, blinking furiously, helplessly straining against the solid shell built around your body, but she ignores your continued protests as she looks towards the merry-go-round, still cheerily spinning along, even after the race has ended.  And then she holds out her hand and, through a trick of visual perspective, picks it up and holds it in her palm.  Now it’s the size of a snow globe, Revissa just one of many tiny figures trapped within its confines.

“More portable this way,” she says with a grin.  “The perfect size to sit on a shelf, right next to my sexy little bedroom award, wouldn’t you say?”

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  All you can do is stand there in place as she takes a few steps back and does the same trick with you – and then, suddenly, you’re only ten inches tall, your metal body able to be snugly gripped in a single hand.  Tears creep at the corners of your eyes as you realize just how helpless you are, just how completely you’ve been defeated.  Revissa was right - never trust a fae.  You’d have been better off being lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you’re both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="171" name="FD06G" tags="" position="2725,1550" size="100,100">You’ve run out of better ideas to win the race, so you decide that in the end, you’re just going to stick with what you know best.  You drop to the floor of the merry-go-round, then hop over the railing, standing on soft soil as you jog alongside Revissa’s cheerily bobbing figure.  Up and down, up and down she goes, moving in time with the carnival music blaring from the speakers.  In the end, the ride is just a machine, right?  Powered by gears and pulleys and other mechanical apparatus.  Well, you’re pretty strong.  Maybe even strong enough to do it better.

Reaching out, you clasp your hand around Revissa’s glossy fingers, holding on tight as you try to increase the pace of your movements.  You pull her along behind you, muscles straining as you attempt to increase the rotation speed of the outer circle of the carnival attraction with pure force of muscle.  And to your delight, it actually works.  You start to gain ground, you and Revissa closing in on not-Skadi and her bunny-taur mount.  And interestingly, as the rotation speed increases, so too does the tempo of the carnival music, as if the two were inexorably tied together.  Not surprising, given fae magic is responsible for the whole thing.  

To be perfectly honest, it looks like it could have worked.  *Could* have.  If only you’d started a bit closer to your opponent.  Because after a full circuit around the track, your strength begins to wane, your heart pounds in your chest, and your legs become sluggish, like you’re pulling yourself through an ocean of molasses.  Eventually, you just can’t keep up, and your fingers slip from Revissa’s hands, even as you were only a few feet away from the rider ahead of you.

The fae woman throws her head back and waves, hair whipping in the wind as she pulls ahead past the finish line.  Her arrival is punctuated by a tinny fanfare from the ride’s speakers, declaring her the winner - and you, unfortunately, the loser.

“Oh, my poor deer, it looks like you didn’t finish first.  Though… you *are* finished.”

And before you get a chance to respond, she snaps her fingers.

[[Claim second place-&gt;FD07A]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="172" name="FD06H" tags="" position="2850,1550" size="100,100">Well, now you’ve at least stopped your opponent from gaining more ground, but that’s not enough, given she’s still ahead.  You’re going to need to find some way to catch up now!

Your mind races for solutions to the problem, and eventually settles on a rather extreme one.  If the ride is rigged to ensure Revissa falls behind, then you’ll just have to physically change it so that it doesn’t.  The two rows of ‘horses’ are arranged on separate, concentrically rotating circles, so if you could somehow manage to jam up the one containing the fae woman’s mount then yours would be able to get ahead.

Leaping from Revissa’s smooth, shiny back, you land on the surface of the ride itself, and pull out your sword from its place at your back.  Getting down on all fours, you carefully study the seam between the two rotating circles, finding a spot that looks like it might be vulnerable to tampering.  Then you jam the end of your blade into the gap, trying to dig it down as far as it can go to mess with whatever gears are turning beneath the surface.

You’re rewarded with an ear-splitting screech as metal grinds against metal, and feel a jolt as half the ride grinds to a halt.  The fae woman looks backwards from her position ahead of you, scowling in annoyance.  You give her a winning smile back, prompting her to flick her finger upwards.  Suddenly, your sword rises up into the air and then sails away into the forest, useless to you for the remainder of the race.  The merry-go-round hums back into full operation, chugging along as not-Skadi continues on her merry way.  But now you’re neck-and-neck with her.

[[Leap and tackle her off her mount-&gt;FD06C]]
[[Lash your mounts together evenly-&gt;FD06I]]
[[Try and pull Revissa ahead with brute strength-&gt;FD06J]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="FD06F" tags="" position="2600,1550" size="100,100">As you fumble for solutions, you get the idea that if Revissa were tightly tethered to the bunny-taur with a strong enough rope, Revissa would essentially get pulled along by the ‘faster’ of the two mounts.  But where can you find a sturdy rope on such short notice?  Looking around, your eyes rest on the colorful banners flapping in the breeze on the outside of the ride, which are attached to the ‘tent’ portion with some thin wires.  Maybe those will do the trick!

Careful of the rotation of the ride beneath you, you reach out, grasping hold of a banner and tugging it down.  To your satisfaction, it comes loose easily.  Then as quick as you are able, you tear off the cloth banner to get to the binding beneath it, giving it a pull to test its strength.  It’ll have to do.  You’re no cowgirl, but you manage to form a passable loop from the metal cord, and then swing it over your head, taking careful aim.

When it’s set loose from your grip, you hold your breath, carefully trying to use your wrist to maneuver it into place - and you’re rewarded by a tug as it finds purchase around the bunny-taur’s neck.  Success!

…though it’s a fleeting one.  Because despite getting it where it needed to be, you now realize that your opponent has already gotten too far ahead in the race, leaving you without enough slack to secure it around Revissa.  Lamely, you try to hold on as tight as you can, but the wire soon slips from your grip, dragging uselessly around the circuit of the track.

A few minutes later you hear the sound of a victory fanfare blaring from the merry-go-round’s tinny speakers, announcing that a winner has crossed the finish line first.  Needless to say, it wasn’t you.  The fae woman looks backwards from her mount, flashing you a victorious smile.

“Oh, my poor deer, it looks like you didn’t finish.  Though… you *are* finished.”

And before you get a chance to respond, she snaps her fingers.

[[Claim second place-&gt;FD07A]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="174" name="FD06I" tags="" position="2600,1675" size="100,100">Now that you’ve caught up, the lasso you’ve tied has fallen slack, no longer serving any purpose.  But you can change that.  If you tighten the tension between the two mounts and fully lash them together, your opponent won’t be able to gain any more distance.  You’d finally be on even ground!

The fae woman watches you with interest as you get to work, seemingly unperturbed by your plan.  In fact, she even helpfully presses a finger against the rope at one point to make it easier to tie a knot.  Her compliance is obviously unsettling.  Why would she be helping you win?  Are you making a mistake?  Or is it some kind of reverse psychology, trying to trick you away from the best option by making it seem like that’s what she wants?

In the end, you know you’re never going to outsmart a fae.  So you just stick with the plan and hope it works.  Before long, Revissa and the bunny mount are tightly connected, moving as one unit as the merry-go-round happily chugs along.  It is only as the finish line approaches that you realize the issue – if they’re both neck and neck, that means they’ll end the race at the same time!  You won’t lose, but you also won’t win.  And you *need* to win if you want to make her honor her deal to turn Revissa back to normal.

“Looks like you’ve figured it out,” the fae woman says with a chuckle.  “Well, how about it?  Do you have any more ideas?  Or will you just accept a tie?”

With the finish line looming, you only have a few moments to make a choice.

[[Accept a tie-&gt;FD06O]]

Not surprising, given fae magic is responsible for the whole thing.  

The soft sound of clapping hands pulls your attention behind you.

“My oh my, what a show!” the fae woman says excitedly, watching intently as sweat pours down your brow, making your muscled physique glisten in the forest air.

She snaps her fingers, and a gust of wind picks up, sending a refreshingly cool chill over your body, before, somehow, it picks up and slides all your clothes off your frame, sending boots and pants and shirts scattering every which way.  It leaves you naked and exposed, every aspect of your anatomy on display for her enjoyment as you try to pull your wife across the finish line.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="FD06O" tags="" position="2600,1950" size="100,100">You look your opponent over, studying her features.  It’s impressive enough that you’ve even managed to make it this far.  Perhaps a tie is the best you can hope for.  Trying anything more would just prompt her to negate your efforts and cause a loss.  Negotiating with a fae is a fool’s errand at best, but at least trying it now you’d be at a place of parity, rather than from a disadvantage.

“Fine,” you eventually say, unable to hide the resignation in your voice.  “I guess I have no choice.”

“So you accept the tie?” the woman chirps.

“Yes, fine, I accept a tie!”

Her face lights up.  “Oh I *was* hoping you’d say that!”

It is only after she snaps her finger that you realize just how foolish it was to let her phrase it like that.  At the sound of her command, the metal wires you’d tied between the two mounts start to come to life, writing around like serpents with a mind of their own.  You don’t even have a moment to react before they leap towards you, transforming into thick leather bands that shred your clothing to pieces as they start to wind themselves around your body.  They curl around your ankles, shins and thighs, catching your arms and wrapping your wrists together behind your back, securing themselves below your breasts and around your shoulders to prevent any attempt at breaking free.  Another snap of her fingers, and a rubber ball shoots forward and presses itself between your lips, more bands shooting out of it to form a tight and secure gag that cuts off any sounds from your mouth besides some plaintive grunts.

Ahead of you, the two horses cross the finish line at exactly the same time, ending literally neck and neck.  A tinny fanfare goes off from the merry-go-round’s loudspeaker, indicating that the race has ended in – you guessed it – a tie.

[[End the race-&gt;FD07C]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="FD06P" tags="" position="2725,1950" size="100,100">You’re not looking for a stalemate here.  You’re trying to win!  And you aren’t going to do that by crossing the finish line together.  So there’s nothing else to do but to cut the bonds you just made.  Unfortunately, you don’t have your sword any more, but you do still have the enchanted dagger that Vhaja lent to you.  You pull the blade from your belt and quickly work on severing the lines, pleased to find that the metal cables snap easily with only a slight bit of pressure.  And once the two mounts are freed, you leap off of Revissa’s back to the ground, taking hold of her hand to start pulling her ahead, using your own speed to outrun the ‘faster’ mount on the inner circle of the ride.

A surge of adrenaline rushes through you, strengthening your muscles as you burn every ounce of stamina to take you through the last leg of the race.   To your delight, it actually works!  You start to pull ahead, you and Revissa slowly chugging past not-Skadi and her bunny-taur mount.  And interestingly, as the rotation speed increases, so too does the tempo of the carnival music, as if the two were inexorably tied together.  Not surprising, given fae magic is responsible for the whole thing.  

Behind you, the fae woman does not seem to mind that you’re about to win.  In fact, she’s rather enjoying the show.  So much so that she snaps her fingers, causing a gust of wind to swirl around you that sends a refreshingly cool chill over your body, before, somehow, it picks up and slides all your clothes off your frame, sending boots and pants and shirts scattering every which way.  It leaves you naked and exposed, every aspect of your anatomy on display for her enjoyment as you finally manage to pull your wife across the finish line.

Your victory is announced with a tinny fanfare blasting from the merry-go-round’s loudspeakers, indicating that, against all odds, you actually managed to win the race.  The fae woman simply smiles and claps her hands politely, her eyes darting up and down your naked, sweat-covered body.

“Congratulations.  You’ve impressed me with your ingenuity… and other assets.  Now how about we throw you a victory party?”

[[Claim your prize-&gt;FD07]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="FD06Q" tags="" position="2850,1950" size="100,100">An idea strikes you as the racers inch towards the finish line - even if the two mounts are tied together, there’s still a tiny bit of wiggle room between them.  And if you could just jam yourself between the mounts, maybe you could shift them just enough so that Revissa’s head nudges forwards, and the bunny-taur’s body falls backwards.  To do so, however, requires you to brace yourself in between the two ‘horses’, your arms wrapped around Revissa’s neck and your legs anchored on the bunny’s bum.  Luckily, your earlier rope-work has left the two in relatively stable balance, allowing you to span the distance between them without falling onto the track below.

After that, it’s just a matter of applying the right force.  Tensing your arms, bracing your legs, and heaving with all the strength your muscles can muster.  You grunt in exertion as the ride nears the goal, barely managing to fight the tension in the ropes and the force of the merry-go-round itself to bend Revissa just a centimeter forward.  Barely a difference, but winning by a nose is still winning.

But… maybe you should have given the plan a bit more thought.  Because, stretched as you are, your legs against not-Skadi’s mount, your taut rump is in open view of your opponent, presenting a tantalizing target.  She takes the unintentionally offered bait, reaching out with two fingers to deliver a sharp, distracting pinch right onto your pert bottom.  The sudden pressure makes you yelp in surprise, shifting the tension in your muscles to reverse the positions of the riders!

It happens only for a moment, but it’s the only moment that matters, as when you finally cross the finish line it’s the bunny-taur’s nose that is ahead.  A tinny fanfare from the merry-go-round’s loudspeaker announces the crowning of a winner.  A winner that, sadly, is not you.

“Oh… so close.  A mishap right at the finish,” the fae woman says.  “But sorry to say, now you *are* finished…”

And then with a smile, she snaps her fingers.

[[Claim second place-&gt;FD07A]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="FD06K" tags="" position="2850,1675" size="100,100">Well if she’s trying to distract you, that just means you need to distract her instead.  Perching up on your seat, you spend a moment to calculate your trajectory, then make a diving lunge towards the shapely fae’s body.  To be honest, it’s a fairly desperate ploy - which is why it surprises you when it works.

You feel soft flesh against your skin as you collide with your opponent, knocking her from her perch and slamming her against the central rotating pillar.  Now you have her pinned beneath you, your powerful arms pressed down on her shoulders to prevent her from regaining her position.  And yet… she does not seem the least bit perturbed.

“Oh… so forward.  Are you trying to claim your prize early?”

There’s only time for you to blink in confusion before she leans in against you and warmly locks lips.  And then… your world falls into a pleasant blur.  You have a vague recollection of hands and teeth and exposed nipples on milky white skin, of dark, silken hair swishing against your back, of hands roughly stroking the fur on your ears and tail.  It feels like it lasts for an eternity, and yet, at the same time, that it is over too soon.

What breaks the reverie is the sound of a victory fanfare blaring from the merry-go-round’s tinny speakers, announcing that a winner has crossed the finish line.  You look at the fae woman in confusion as she lustily strokes the inner fuzz on your ear with a hand.

“Don’t look so surprised.  It’s not like this game was impossible or anything - there has to be *some* chance that you come ahead.”

Sure enough, Revissa’s glossy figure is a few inches in front of the opposing mount, making her - and thus, you - the winner of the race.  

“It was a lot of fun, wasn’t it?” the fae woman says, lazily rolling out from beneath you and manifesting her clothing back onto her body with a snap of her fingers.  “Now why don’t we throw you a little victory party.”

Her eyes sparkle alluringly, and you find yourself nodding along in compliance at her words.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="180" name="FD06L" tags="" position="2600,1800" size="100,100">You’re not going to let her distract you from winning - not when you’ve finally managed to pull ahead!  So, despite the sudden loss of clothing, you keep at what you were doing, holding on to Revissa for deer life as you pull her closer and closer to the goal.  You can feel your strength starting to give out, your muscles screaming for relief, every inch of you slick and glistening with perspiration, but you push them onwards for just a little bit longer.  A few seconds… that’s all you need!  At this point, you’re pretty sure even if you ran out of steam you’d still have enough of a lead to pull out a win.

But then… that wind picks up again.  The same one that knocked off all your clothes.  It’s stiff and bracing, sending a chill that creeps like icy tendrils along your body.  You ignore it.  No sexy fae is going to divert you from your goal!  

And yet… you *can’t* ignore it.  Because as the cool breeze wraps around you, it starts to effect a change.  All that sweat you’ve built up, that slick condensation on your skin, it begins to dry.  No – dry isn’t the right word.  Maybe it would be better to call it congeal.  It *hardens*.  All too late do you realize what your foe is trying to do.  And by the time it occurs to you, she has already succeeded.

Your perspiration forms a clear, glistening layer of your skin, almost like a lacquer, a shiny glaze, and as it cools, it also crackles and stiffens, traps and encases, freezing your muscles in place and preventing you from covering the last few feet to the goal.  You finally let go of your grip, holding your hands out to your sides as a look of confusion spreads along your features.  But there’s nothing you can do about it now.  And with an ominous *shwing* sound that echoes through the clearing, you petrify completely, becoming a glossy and gleaming statue beneath a lacquer magically formed from your own sweat and start to tip over.

Frozen as you are, you cannot stop yourself from clattering against the ground, making a dull, hollow *think* sound as you strike the grass.  Upon impact, you wobble ever so slightly, the stiffness of your tail serving as a fulcrum to make you vibrate for a few seconds before you come to a rest.  Stuck as you are, all you can do is stare forward as you watch the rest of the race play out without you.

Up ahead, Revissa’s equally shiny figure passes the finish line first, prompting a tinny fanfare to play from the merry-go-round’s speakers.  But you’re in no position to celebrate the win.  Because now you’re just as helpless as she is.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="181" name="FD06M" tags="" position="2725,1800" size="100,100">An idea strikes you as your muscles strain from the exertion of your plan.  At this point, Revissa is far enough ahead that even with the advantage of her ‘faster’ mount, the fae woman still wouldn’t be able to win.  At least, not unless she pulls another one of her tricks.  Which means your best bet for victory is to stop her from doing anything more to mess up your plan.  After all, if she’s able to strip you naked with a snap of her finger, what else could she do to disrupt you?

Better to disrupt her, first!  And so you let go of Revissa’s hand, instead reaching for the length of wire you had previously used to even the odds.  With a dextrous tug, you loosen the knots around Revissa’s half, then follow it up with a pull to free the fae woman’s mount from the loop.

The woman raises an eyebrow as you go about your business, clearly interested in what you’re planning next.

“Well, it’s not quite horseback, and I’m no cowgirl… but I think I can still wrangle myself something nice,” you say with a smirk, spinning the loop of the lasso over your head, then tossing it towards your target.

“Ah,” your opponent says, disappointment evident in her voice.  “How boring.”

And then with a flick of her finger, a gust of wind kicks the lasso right back towards *you*!  Unable to move away in time, the wires collide with your body, somehow changing in shape and size to become thick bands of leather that wrap around your ankles, shins and thighs, catching your arms and restraining your wrists together behind your back, securing themselves below your breasts and around your shoulders to prevent any attempt at breaking free.  Another flick, and rubber ball shoots forward and presses itself between your lips, more bands shooting out of it to form a tight and secure gag that cuts off any sounds from your mouth besides some plaintive grunts.

Ahead of you, not-Skadi’s mount regains its advantage, managing to just barely catch up to Revissa as she glides past the finish line, ending literally neck and neck.  A tinny fanfare goes off from the merry-go-round’s loudspeaker, indicating that the race has ended in – you guessed it – a tie.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="182" name="FD07" tags="" position="3025,1275" size="100,100">Against all odds, you won.  It took every ounce of wit and ingenuity in your arsenal, as well as no small amount of good old-fashioned elbow grease.  After straining yourself so hard, you’re sweaty and exhausted, naked body glistening with perspiration.  Now that’s it’s finally over, you’re able to just flop over onto your back and catch your breath, looking up into the bright sky above you.

A face appears in front of you, the curvaceous fae leaning over your prone body.  “Lying down on the job?  When you have a victory party to attend?  For shame!”

You groan as you pick yourself up, immediately noticing the change in your surroundings.  Now in place of the merry-go-round is one of those three-tiered victory platforms, with three different heights for first, second, and third place.  At the lowest tier, you see the merry-go-round itself, somehow shrunken down to be about the size of a snow globe.  The fae woman cheerily hops up onto the second-place platform, then motions for you to climb to the top.

“Let’s just get this over with,” you mutter, pulling yourself up to take your spot as the first-place winner.

As you do, canned applause begins to ring out from around you, an invisible crowd cheering your victory.  You can’t help but be distracted by it.  Even the most humble of heroes enjoys being recognized for their talent every once in a while.

“And the winner is… Melfy!” says an unseen announcer, making the audience’s voices raise to a fever pitch.  “And now she is offered a golden trophy as her prize!”

Beside you, the fae woman holds out a gleaming golden chalice mounted on an award stand, pushing it towards you. (if: $faekiss is true)[For a moment, a pang of hesitation grips you.  This isn’t the prize you wanted, is it?  But then you meet the fae woman’s eyes, and your body recalls the softness of her touch, the intensity of her passion, and you fall into a dreamy daze.  What else is there to do but…

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="183" name="FD07B" tags="" position="3000,1550" size="100,100">“Congratulations!” the fae woman yells, appearing before you in a puff of smoke.  “You’ve won!  What ingenuity!  What cleverness!  I knew you had it in you!”

She claps you on the back, making a light squeaking noise against your stiff, glossy body.

“You and your friends are so very resourceful, you know.  Always pulling out impossible wins in the final moment.  I’ve been keeping track of your exploits for a while now.  Ever since the four of you first teamed up.”

It feels like so long ago that you, Krysta, Vhaja, and Lumina crossed paths.  Went on adventures together.  Like she said, there were a lot of close calls.  There were plenty of times you nearly ended up as trophies for some villain or another.  But you’re starting to get a creeping suspicion that this might be the time it happens for real.

“So, as promised, it’s time for me to give you a prize.  I’ll go ahead and make a suggestion for what you can win, and if you don’t like it, just suggest something different, alright?”

“..........” 

With your lips frozen beneath the shiny lacquer, you can’t make a sound, one way or another.  

“So, how about this.  As a prize for being the winner, I’ll keep your lovely wife as part of my merry-go-round for the rest of eternity, and you as my glossy little trophy for the same duration.  Neither of you will ever be freed without my express approval, and no one will ever be able to save you.  How does that sound?”

“...!” 

You try to yell out a protest, but the fae woman cannot hear you.

She pokes your nose playfully.  “Just say ‘no I do not accept these terms’ and I’ll come up with something better.  But while we’re pitching ideas… how about I also track down your other friends and add them to my collection as well?  Say something if you disagree.”

“........!”

“You’re sure?  All you need to do is say the words – otherwise I’ll assume you accept my proposal.”

“.......................!”

“Well, if you insist… very well.  The deal is agreed upon.  You and your wife shall now belong to me for the rest of time.  And I’ll go ahead and capture the rest of your merry crew as well!”

A terrible dread sits in to the pit of your stomach.  This is just about the worst outcome imaginable.  You continue trying to catch her attention, but you can’t move a muscle, can’t make a sound, can’t do anything but watch through the glaze coating your eyes as she looks towards the merry-go-round, still cheerily spinning along, even after the race has ended.  And then she holds out her hand and, through a trick of visual perspective, picks it up and holds it in her palm.  Now it’s the size of a snow globe, Revissa just one of many tiny figures trapped within its confines.

“More portable this way,” she says with a grin.  “The perfect size to sit on a shelf, right next to my sexy little bedroom toy, wouldn’t you say?”

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  All you can do is stand there in silent contemplation, the light gleaning off of your inert figure.  After so many adventures, it’s all just resulted in this, caught by a cruel and wicked fae, powerless to stop her from doing the same to the rest of your friends. You’d have been better off being lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you and Revissa are both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

And you can’t overpower the grip of the taut, firm bands holding you tightly in place.  You’re caught.  Completely and utterly.  There’s nothing you can do but writhe helplessly, fruitlessly pushing against the bindings that have entrapped you with such absolute precision.

“Well then,” says the fae woman, walking over to inspect your helpless form, “it seems like we’ve ended the match in a tie.”

She snaps her finger, causing a line of wire to snake down and loop around the binds at your ankles, then yank upwards to hoist you upside down into the air.  More leather bands dart outwards from the sides to secure you against some support poles.  Now you can’t even squirm, held taut from every possible side.

“So… since we didn’t iron it out beforehand, I suppose we should do it now.  Let’s have a negotiation - what happens if the race ends in a draw.  I’ll make my pitch first.  If the game ends without a winner, I’ll keep your lovely wife as part of my merry-go-round for the rest of eternity, and you as my lovely little plaything for the same duration.  Neither of you will ever be freed without my express approval, and no one will ever be able to save you.  How does that sound?”

“Mmmpgggh!” you yell into your gag.

She pokes your nose playfully.  “Just say ‘no I do not accept these terms’ and I’ll come up with something better.  But while we’re pitching ideas… how about I also track down your other friends and add them to my collection as well?  Say something if you disagree.”

A terrible dread sits in to the pit of your stomach, and your fur stands on end as you can somehow *feel* the contract coming into effect.  This is just about the worst outcome imaginable.  You continue grunting into your gag, but she ignores your continued protests as she looks towards the merry-go-round, still cheerily spinning along, even after the race has ended.  And then she holds out her hand and, through a trick of visual perspective, picks it up and holds it in her palm.

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  Tears creep at the corners of your eyes as you realize just how helpless you are, just how completely you’ve been defeated.  Revissa was right - never trust a fae.  You’d have been better off wandering lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you’re both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="185" name="FD07D" tags="" position="3125,1675" size="100,100">You arrive in a strange, unfamiliar place, a location stuck outside of time.  It has the overall appearance of a curio shop, shelves lining the walls, antiques filling out every table.  On one wall, a giant grandmother clock.  Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.  Behind the glass of the clock, a tsunojian is shackled in place, the pendulum tick-tocking between her two heaving breasts.  And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.  And the basin of the birdbath, of course, is clutched between the fingers of a petrified elvaan, the placid smile etched onto her face belying the terror she must have felt in the moment her fate was sealed.

It is to the back of the room where you are taken, behind a curtain that conceals a small living quarters, a bed, a bookshelf, a writing desk, a nightstand.  Revissa’s tiny merry-go-round is set down on a small pedestal right beside the bed, perfectly slotting into the circular surface, almost like it was built to house her.  It probably was.  

(if: $faebound is true)[As for you, your bound and gagged form is slotted into a nice little nook right between the bookshelf and a dresser, firmly anchored in place in such a way as to provide not even an inch of wiggle room for your struggles.](else-if: $faeshiny is true )[As for you, your glossy form is nestled into a little nook right between the bookshelf and the dresser, mounted on a small stand complete with display hook that snaps around your ankle to hold you in place.](else-if: $faetrophy is true )[As for you, your trophy is set down on top of the bookshelf, giving you a clear view of the room and its contents.]

“There we are,” says the smugly grinning fae, appreciating how the two of you add to the ambience of the room.  “But… it’s still missing something.  Hold on - I’ll be right back!”

And then she is gone in a puff of smoke once more.  You can’t tell how long she’s gone.  It could be a minute, it could be years.  Time seems to have no meaning here.  But when she returns, she has more items to add to the decor.

(set: $picF29 to true)

The first is a small, flat, rectangular object - a playing card?  No, it’s more than that.  The fae woman makes sure to hold it up to the light so that you can get a good look at it - at what’s trapped inside.  Within the holographic gleam of the card you can see Lumina’s image, etched onto its surface, eyes wide, arms pressed up against the image as if she were trying to escape.  But there’s no way she’ll be able to get out.  None of you can.  The fae slips the card inside a protective plastic sleeve, then tucks it into a binder that she files away in the bookcase.]

(set: $picF30 to true)

After that, she moves to her desk, flicking a finger to produce a heavy-looking golden object, maybe about six inches tall, rectangular on all sides.   An ornate paperweight.  She uses it to pin down some documents sitting there, really letting the light glean off of its gilded surface.  Only when she spins it can you see the figure embedded, four times, on each flat surface of the object.  It’s Vhaja.  A look of mute confusion is forever marked onto her face, her arms and legs neatly held at her sides so she can fit into the requisite surface area. All her talent and skill seems to have been useless to prevent her capture.]

Next, the fae woman moves to her bed.  She sits down atop the sheets, testing the springiness of the mattress, the fluffiness of the pillows.  Before she reaches into thin air and extracts an adorable little plush doll to nestle in against the headboard.  Krysta.  She’s in human form, wearing her street clothes and not her Star Scout uniform, big, brown eyes nothing more than felt decorations on her stuffed head.  Perhaps to taunt her, the collector tilts her head so she is looking towards the bookcase where her angelic lover is trapped.  There’s nothing she can do to enact a rescue - she can’t even save herself, trapped as she is.]

And then, finally, she slinks to the nightstand.  One more time, she flicks her hand, and one more time she produces the helpless form of one your crew.  Jyumon’s body is about eight inches tall, made of hard plastic, molded into a glossy sheen.  She’s wearing the outfit of a popular holo-game character whose name you can’t remember, noteworthy for her rather… generous proportions.  She fills out the costume well.  The fae sets her down onto the nightstand, tilting her so she looks towards the writing desk, though there is no change in the expression on her face as she holds the same saucy pose she is trapped in, folding fan jauntily clutched between her inert fingers.

“There we are!” she says with a bright smile.  “Perfect!  All our little heroes, trapped forever in one place.  I couldn’t just pick one or two - I had to go for the whole set!”

She does a little twirl, before leaning in towards your face, poking you in the nose.

“And I do mean forever.  There’s no getting out of this one, my lovely little toy.  No last-minute rescue.  All of you are mine.  And will remain mine, until I decide to let you go.  But let’s be honest… such a lovely collection as this one, I don’t see that happening any time soon.”

There’s nothing you can do.  You’re trapped, helpless.  Revissa is a glossy merry-go-round seat.  Lumina’s a holographic card, Vhaja’s a paperweight, Krysta’s a plush doll, and Jyumon a glossy model figure.  They won’t be saving you, and you won’t be saving them.  You messed with a fae, and now you’ve paid the price.

Three more silver statues in a row beside you, all lined up evenly with yourself.  She sure to give you a good look at each one of them before she sets them in place, letting you see fully the fates of your dearest friends.

“I’ve always been more partial to the original foursome,” she explains, setting Krysta down right beside you.  Your best friend stands in gleaming relief on her trophy platform, holding her trademark ice blaster pistol in one hand, and slinging her pet weasel Knocker over the other.  The engraving on her platform reads “Boobie Prize”, perhaps hinting at the competition she failed to end up like this.  If the fae woman appeared to her in the same form as she did to you, it’s easy to imagine the red-head getting tempted by her impressive bust and falling into a trap.  Whatever the circumstances, her big brown eyes can only dart back and forth as she suffers for her folly.]

Next comes Vhaja, always your must trusted confidant.  Her naked figure sways slightly at the hips, arms raised above her head, long hair braids dangling behind her.  Bright green eyes flicker with intense thought, desperately trying to conjure up some plan that will get the lot of you out of this mess.  She’d always had such an analytic mind.  The marking on her pedestal reads “Science Fair” - perhaps she was roped into a quiz show of some sort, or was forced to solve an engineering problem.  EIther way, it’s clear she failed.  And now that brilliant mind of hers is trapped in a body that cannot ever act on any of the plans she concocts.]

And finally comes Lumina.  The curvaceous angel is frozen as if in mid-takeoff, her legs perched on her trophy stand, arms extend, wings flaring out behind her.  Her purple eyes radiate confusion and worry, expressing bewilderment at how she’s ended up here as nothing but a collectible.  What kind of game did the fae play with her?  Her engraving reads “Best Girl”... what could it mean?  Perhaps she was offered the chance to be reunited with her partner, always the faithful lover, but did not expect that the cunning fae would turn her into a trophy as well as a result.

Whatever the circumstances, the lot of you are here, and you are trapped. And once your captor is certain you’re all aware of each other’s presence, she slinks to the nightstand.  One more time, she flicks her hand, and one more time she produces the helpless form of one your crew.]

You can’t for the life of you imagine why - it’s not like you have any agency at all to influence her mood.  But one day she comes out and says it.  What feels like a lifetime ago, you sucked down a Star Scout homing beacon, and ever since you’ve been captured it’s been sending out pulses into the void.

All at once, you and your friends appear in a naked pile in the middle of a remote planet.  No gear, no equipment, no idea how long you’ve been gone, or how you’ll make your way back to civilization.  She doesn’t care - she just wants to put an end to the incessant ringing.  Then she vanishes in her signature puff of smoke, leaving your party to their own devices.

What follows is an exciting adventure in its own right, but it’s not the adventure we’re here to tell today.  And, regardless, your actions have led to failing your original mission.  Maybe next time you’ll think better about getting tangled up with a fae.

As soon as you do, you feel a strange ripple in the space around you, as if something kind of intangible truth has just been locked into place.  It makes you shiver in fear for a moment, but then you lock eyes with the woman and any doubts melt away from your mind.

“As a golden trophy,” the announcer voice says, cutting through the din of the cheering crowd.  “Melfy will be the eternal property of the second-place winner.  She will have no power, no agency, and will be forever nothing more than a collectable knick-knack, to be done with as her owner pleases.”

Wait… what?  You didn’t agree to that!  You’re supposed to win the prize, not become it!  And yet, as if in a trance, you smile broadly, holding your arms over your head and flexing to the delight of the invisible crowd.

“Of course, our winner will be joined by her wife, who shall remain trapped forever as a glossy merry-go-round horse.  They will be part of the same collection, protected by their new owner for the rest of their days.”

No… no!  You don’t want this!  But you’re powerless to resist it now, the spell is too strong.  You’ve become completely overwhelmed by the cheering, the fanfare.  And now you feel your body starting to stiffen, your powerful muscles turning numb.

“In addition, the second-place winner will make every effort to hunt down and capture all of our champion’s companions as well, trapping them with similar games that they can’t ever hope to win at!”

This isn’t what you wanted… this isn’t fair!  You won!  You beat her!  And yet, your frozen body begins to shrink, the world around you seeming to pull away higher and higher.  You can’t stop it from happening.  You can’t resist.  Can’t do anything but stand there with that stupid smile stuck on your face, as the numbness spreads to your neck.

“And once all six of them are defeated, they will be entered into a collection and put on display forevermore, with no hope of rescue!”

A single tear dribbles down from your eye as the numbness eclipses your face.  And then… you become the prize you were fighting for.

Now you’re nothing but a golden trophy, claimed by the person you thought you had defeated.  If only you’d tried harder to resist the siren’s call that victory tempted you with.  (if: $faekiss is true)[Perhaps if you hadn’t tackled the fae woman to the ground and rolled in the hay with her, you’d have had enough mental fortitude to choose something else than what you’ve now found yourself stuck in.]  But it doesn’t matter now.  All that matters is that the game is over - and despite winning, you still feel like a loser.  

“Well, that was fun,” says the fae woman, now easily five or six times your size.  She wraps her hands around your golden midsection and brings you up in front of her face so she can inspect you from all sides.  “I hope you enjoyed it too.  And now you get the prize of belonging to me forever, along with all of your friends.  A pretty good deal, wouldn’t you say?”

You wouldn’t, but you can’t.  All you can do is stand there in silent contemplation, the light gleaming off of your inert figure.  After so many adventures, it’s all just resulted in this, caught by a cruel and wicked fae, powerless to stop her from doing the same to the rest of your friends. You’d have been better off being lost in that forest forever.  But instead, now you and Revissa are both just two more playthings in the collection of an impossibly powerful being.

And with another snap of her fingers, you vanish from the forest, never to return again.

No… there’s something not right here.  You won the game, you should be happy!  And yet… you feel the fur on your tail standing on end.  What is it Revissa always says - never trust a fae, never accept their gifts.  Well one is trying to give you something right now.  But you’re not having it.

With a powerful swipe of your arms, you knock the proffered trophy from the woman’s grip, sending it careening to the ground.  The moment it strikes the earth, the cheering stops, the victory platform vanishes, and the tiny merry-go-round containing your frozen wife appears in your hands.

“Well, that’s no fun,” says the fae lady with an adorable pout, pressing her sultry body up against you playfully.  “Are you *sure* you don’t want to be my sexy little trophy?  I’d take such good care of you!”

You slip out of her grasp.  “I’m gonna have to pass, sorry.  As my prize for winning, I demand you return Revissa back to normal.”

She frowns, but then holds up her hand as an idea strikes her.  “Now hold on… before you go asking for any prizes, I have an offer for you.”

“Not interested.”

“Ugh, just listen!  This one’s *really* spicy.”  She appears behind you, pressing her soft chest against your back.  “Why don’t we play one more game.  A very simple one.  If I win… I get to keep you, of course.  But if *you* win… you get to keep *me*.”

That at least gives you pause.  

“I get to keep you?”

“That’s right.  You can trap me however you like, and I’ll be yours.  Up until you die – or until your fate is sealed by someone else.”

Okay, this is obviously another trick.  One last bit of temptation to try and trap you in her web of lies.  And yet… the feeling of her bosom pressed against you is so tantalizing, the way her warm breath brushes against your ears, her hands gently massaging the muscles of your arm.  It *would* be nice to keep her… if only to remove such a dangerous being from causing any more mischief.  And after all, you already managed to win one of her games - who’s to say you can’t win another?

[[Play another game-&gt;FD08]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="194" name="FD08" tags="" position="3400,1400" size="100,100">This is stupid.  You *know* this is stupid.  After how far you’ve come avoiding getting caught by her, it’s utterly bonkers to throw yourself into another one of her games.  But like it or not, you’ve fallen under her spell.  The temptation to have her for yourself is just too great to ignore.

“Alright… I’m in.  Let’s play another game.”

She actually looks surprised at your decision.  “Really?  Wow, I can’t believe that worked.  You didn’t even ask what the game would be!  But it’s too late to back out now!”

You know it was a stupid choice, but you don’t really appreciate her rubbing it in like that.

“So… first, the stakes.  If I lose, you get to keep me for the rest of your life, in whatever form you choose.  And if *I* win… I get to keep you.  And your wife.  And I’ll track down your friends and keep them, too.”

“...wait!  I never agreed to that!”

“You agreed to a game without even hearing the rules.  What did you expect?”

This was, admittedly, an incredibly dumb choice on your part.  But what’s done is done, so now you just have to win.

“So… what *is* the game, then?”

“Oh, it really is quite simple.  All you have to do to win… is speak my name.”

You blink in confusion.  That’s it?  But wait… how could you possibly know her name?

“Err… but I don’t know your name,” you say lamely.

“Indeed.  Quite the conundrum you find yourself in.  Anyway, you have ten seconds.  Get it right, or be mine forever.  So, what’s it gonna be, wolfie?”

[[Take a guess-&gt;FD08A]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="195" name="FD09" tags="" position="2700,2225" size="100,100">You shake your head.

“No dice.  Turn my wife back and leave us alone.  That’s what I want.”

The fae woman pouts.  “You’re sure?”

For a brief moment, you’re gripped by a pang of anxiety.  Are you somehow making the wrong choice?  Is this another trick?  Were you supposed to say something else, some magic words that would actually get her to do what you want?  But you bite your doubts down.  No one ever survived an encounter with a fae by being indecisive.

“Yes, I’m sure.  Return Revissa to normal.”

“Ugh, fine.  Maybe you’re not as fun as I thought.”

She snaps her fingers, and the tiny merry-go-round in your hand starts to spin, whirling faster and faster until one of the ‘horses’ shoots out and smashes into you.  And when you look up, Revissa is laying on top of you, hale and hearty.  You throw your arms around her and hold her tight.  What follows is a kiss more passionate than anything in recent memory.

“I told you… never trust a fae,” she says when you finally come up for air.

“I could sue you for discrimination, you know,” says the woman, poking her face between the two of you.

Revissa bats her away.

“Oh, I know - you’re still lost, aren’t you?  I can help guide you –”

“No!” you and your wife shout in unison.

The woman throws up her hands.

“Fine then.  Enjoy the scenery, I guess!  And remember - don’t always believe everything you see or hear!”

And then, mercifully, she’s gone.  The best way to beat a fae is to make them lose interest in you.  It seems like you’ve finally succeeded.  

The two of you have something of a tradition when it comes to barely escaping nigh-insurmountable peril.  And the two of you engage in it now.  It involves your bodies getting even closer to one another than they already are, and a whole lot of kissing.  On the lips and other places.  After thirty minutes you lay beside each other, naked and panting on the grass.   In a minute you’ll put your clothes back on and continue exploring, but for the moment you’re just happy to be together.

Only thanks to the fae woman’s intervention were you able to escape the first time.  Without her, will you be able to survive a second?

Maybe it would be better to turn around now and try a different path through the woods, one which is easier to navigate.  It would be a huge waste of time, but better late to complete the mission than never, right?

But for now, all you can do is keep moving forward.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="198" name="FD09D" tags="" position="2950,2350" size="100,100">You’re not going to turn back now, not after everything you’ve been through.  Yes, you’re still not fully sure how to navigate the forest, but that seems like such a quaint complication after the insanity you’ve lived through.  It’s not every day you have a merry-go-round race on your wife’s back, after all.

And so, gathering up your equipment… and your courage, you begin to walk.  Revissa follows dutifully alongside you, vigilant against any more unwanted intrusion from fairies, trees, and monsters.  You keep your eyes glued to your map screen for the first hour or so, but eventually, you’re forced to admit that it still isn’t working this deep in.  Whatever lured you into that tar pit is still around here, still holds claim over the twisting passages of trees.

But that’s fine.  You’re feeling more confident now, more sure of yourself.  Maybe the map isn’t working, but you still have your innate sense of direction, complications be damned!  And as you walk, you think about what the fae woman said before she parted ways - don’t trust your eyes or your ears.  Fair enough.  So instead, you’ll trust your mind and your heart.  You keep walking, recklessly, arrogantly assuming you know what you’re doing, never once looking down at the map.  And against all odds, it seems to work.  Because as you barrel past yet another identical cluster of bushes, your comm device makes a pleasant beep to let you know you’re approaching the destination you had programmed into it.

It should have been a moment of triumph, but at the exact same instant, you happen to hear something else.  Claws scraping against dirt, a low growl, leaves rustling as a predator approaches.  Already running on instinct, you clutch your sword and wheel around towards the threat without stopping to think whether it’s a good idea.

And because of that, your instincts have been honed to a razor sharp edge, letting you pick up on danger where other women would have continued on unawares.

Usually, that experience is a good thing.  Normally, reacting quickly can save your life.  Sadly, this time, it proves to have the opposite effect.  Because as you wheel around, you find yourself looking right into the eyes of a large, squat, bulky lizard with vibrant scales the same pastiche of colors as the leaves crumpled up on the ground.  

That trained mind of yours, honed by years of instinct, warns you of the threat you now face a micro-second before your body begins to seize up.  You have just enough time to start to recoil, for your eyes to widen, for your lips to part and for a warning to begin to form on your tongue.  The warning never escapes your lips before your face turns to granite.

What you’ve discovered, creeping up on you in the brush, is a basilisk.  A creature known for its ability to turn flesh to stone as soon as one meets its gaze.  In a universe where you were less perceptive, you might have been better off.  But that’s not the universe you currently occupy.

If there’s any mercy, it’s that the transformation is shockingly swift.  Your ears have a moment to register the telltale crackling sound, your muscles have the opportunity to feel how swiftly they are stiffening.  And your eyes have a blissful few seconds to register the bright yellow pupils of the monster that entrapped you, before they become little more than blank, sightless orbs.

Given how many adventures you’ve made it through, this would be a rather ignominious way to end one.  But as your clothing turns brittle and crumples away, and your mind falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, you realize with your last gasp of consciousness that life is not always fair.  The greatest of stories can end in a heartbeat with one mistimed step.  And it seems yours has met just such an unsatisfying conclusion.

You were standing before, but now you’re on your back, looking up at the canopy of branches above as Revissa leans over you with an expression equal parts relieved and annoyed.

“Well… I’m glad these things work,” she says, slipping one of Lumina’s celestially charged healing diamonds back into her pouch.

“I was…” you begin groggily.

“Rock hard, yes.  I always loved how firm your abs were, but this was a bit much.”

You rub your head wearily, making use of muscles that had been rendered utterly stiff for several hours.

“The… monster?  I saw it, I–”

Revissa chuckles.  “I scared it off.  It wasn’t really dangerous, probably just protecting its territory.”

Lucky for you it wasn’t.  And that you were being so much more aggressive in your movements and reactions than Revissa was.  If you’d both looked at it at the same time… well, there wouldn’t have been anyone around to use that healing diamond.

Either way, you’re alive now, and not just a hunk of stone.  And you’ve made it far enough into the forest that your destination is but a stone’s throw away.  Your clothes were destroyed when you were petrified, but the use of one of Jyumon’s matter re-synthesizer capsules gives you an exact duplicate of your outfit, meaning that once you do some stretches to work out the last gasps of stiffness from your muscles, you’re good to go.

Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.  Behind the glass of the clock, a tsunojian is shackled in place, the pendulum tick-tocking between her two heaving breasts.  And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.  And the basin of the birdbath, of course, is clutched between the fingers of a petrified elvaan, the placid smile etched onto her face belying the terror she must have felt in the moment her fate was sealed.

You feel intense sympathy for all the captured women on display throughout the floor.  Because you, like them, are now a prisoner.  

“Well, girls?  How does it feel?” the fae whose name is not Skadi asks.  “Comfy?”

You wish you knew what to call her.  If you had, you wouldn’t be in this situation right now.  None of you would be.

The last thing you remember, you were in the forest.  And you and Revissa were the only ones victimized by the sultry trickster’s machinations.  But now, all of you are part of her collection.  Between each of your lips, a rubber ball gag, snugly sealing off your voices.  Around your limbs, thick, restrictive leather bands, binding you against a wooden display board mounted on the wall.  You’ve been made out to be hunting trophies.  Though in a sense, that’s what you all are.  Because you *were* hunted, you *were* caught, and now you *are* helpless to do anything but squirm.

“So, some ground rules.  The bindings are magical, of course.  So even our slippery red-headed friend here will have no chance of wiggling out.  They’re… conceptual, rather than physical, the *idea* of leather straps.  Struggle all you want, you will never make the tiniest bit of headway in getting free.

She gives Krysta an affectionate squeeze on the rump before moving on.

“Second, you’re in my home realm now, so you won’t ever age, won’t ever grow hungry or tired, and won’t ever come to any harm.  Well, not unless you consider being my toy harmful.”

Her fingers brush through Lumina’s feathers.

“Third, you are mine now.  In a metaphysical sense.  The universe sees you as my property.  Don’t try to wrap your pretty little heads around it, you wouldn’t be able to understand.  Not in the way I do.  Because you see, I exist at a higher level than the rest of you, I can see the story and how it ends.  And it ends with all of you, here, in this place, as part of my collection.  Forever.”

She walks up and strokes your tail with one hand, and massages Vhaja’s thigh with the other.

“Now you might be wondering - what about your lovely girlfriends?  Why aren’t they here on display with you?  Well, two reasons.  One - this commission already cost a lot as it was.  Such lovely art, by the way.  But two - because I consider you four the real protagonists, and those other two as bonuses.  Add-ons.  An expansion pack, if you will.  But that doesn’t mean I haven’t caught them, and it doesn’t mean they can’t spend eternity mounted up on a wall, just like you four.”

A snap of her finger, and two more additions appear in the room.]

On one wall is Jyumon, naked, encased in a clear plastic vacbed, limbs splayed awkwardly as she looks out at the room, sees the four of you, realizes the fate you’ve found yourselves in.  She and Vhaja lock eyes, exchanging helpless, defeated glances.  They know enough about the magical world to know there’s no escaping when a fae this powerful has her hands on you.

“And, of course, the lovely deer… though goodness, we should get new art of her.  That old design really doesn’t do her cuteness justice, does it?”]

Revissa is encased in freezium and mounted above a lit fireplace, a lock of shock etched onto her face.  Sadly, you and she can not exchange despondent looks, because she is fully inert, trapped in stasis, unconscious (you hope).  Perhaps she’s the lucky one.

“So yes, there you go.  All of you are here, all of you are mine, and none of you will ever escape.  No rescue is coming, not here, not in my place of power.  No salvation, no silver lining, no last-minute heroics.  This is the end for all of you.  I win, you lose.  And all because a silly little wolfie thought she could beat me at my own game.

She squeezes one of your breasts lovingly, then leans in close.

“However, I suppose I can give you a little hint for the next time you take a guess.  Even we fae need to play by rules - there needs to always be a *chance* that our victims can win.  The magic doesn’t *work* otherwise.  But it’s only ever a chance, and that chance doesn’t need to be fair.  So here’s a little riddle for you.  Well, not for *you*, but those lovely people watching at home.  If you’re lucky, maybe they’ll figure it out, and have you make a different guess next time we play.  So, you ready?  You might want to write this down:”]

|drink3)[(link:&quot;Listen to my riddle&quot;)[(show:?drink4)]]

|drink4)[**For you who wish to know my name, a riddle I shall share
Throughout this game the letters hide, the question is just where
I’ll tell you straight there’s four of them, one’s big and three are small
To find them will be quite a feat, each one a treasure’s haul

The first, you see, it hides in code, you’ll find it in a while
Before we flip, my image gleans, you’ll have to check the file
name Your price to me - not so high, add up all three numbers
Right? Click it once and then you’ll see that’s where the letter slumbers.

Now for the second, this is fun, we’ll return from whence we came
You thought grim fates were absent here, but really you’re to blame
Have no candy, leave it off, when you’re sailing out in space
Find your way to failure then, to gain my letter’s grace

For the third you’ll need to look real hard, examine all the options
Make sure the chapter’s visible, to mix up this concoction
The name you’ll want has MAX or MAY, depending on your preference
It’s not capital, but that’s okay, give the hungry plant its deference

The fourth of them was always there, even when you first began
But it shrouds itself in shadow, so you’ll need to have a plan
In high light it reveals itself, but you’ll have to search real low
This version’s nice, but I still think there’s deeper we can go**

(set: $faeriddle to true)
“Got all that?  I hope so. Maybe next time, it means we’ll get a different result.”

And now she steps away, looking her new prizes over one last time.

“And so, I bid you adieu.  I have more cuties to catch, more heroes to pluck from more timestreams to add to my gallery.  So until next we meet… don’t go anywhere!”

The echoes of her laughter linger in the room far after she vanishes, leaving you all alone with the rest of her collection.

You and your friends attracted the attention of an otherworldly being with unimaginable power, and now all of you are nothing but baubles for her collection.  Though as the years passes on, it becomes clear that you, for whatever reason, are her favorite.

Sure, every once in a while she’ll lovingly stroke Lumina’s wings, or trace a finger along the length of Vhaja’s long, pointed ear.  Krysta gets a peck on the cheek, a squeeze on the rump as she passes by, treated with the same amount of interest as a painting hanging from the wall. Sometimes she might take a cloth and polish Revissa’s inert body, or spray some cleaning solution on the clear plastic casing keeping Jyumon sealed away, making sure there’s no errant smudges.  But it’s you that gets to have ‘fun’.

Every once in a while, the fae gets that lusty look in her eyes, and decides to make use of you as something more than a decoration.  She’ll start with her fingers deftly slipped between your lower lips, churning away until you reach a point of helpless distraction.  And while you’re dazed, she’ll pull down your display stand off the wall and set it on the floor, lowering herself on top of your face and grinding herself to completion.  At no point do any of your bindings loosen even an iota.  In a way, you feel guilty, because it’s the only thing you have to look forward to breaking the monotony of your existence, and it’s apparently an honor reserved only for you.  When the woman is finished, she leaves her slick residue staining your body, putting you back on display so all your friends can see what your purpose is.

Her attention is the one distraction from an otherwise bland eternity of helplessness, with you and your crew doomed to spend eternity in her collection.  No rescue ever comes.  No mercy is ever given.  You’re just toys to her, and toys you shall remain.  

Forever.

And she does seem to enjoy those encounters.  But you start to notice that, as the ages flow by, every time she draws near you, she grows increasingly irate.  Testy, irritable.  You can’t for the life of you imagine why - it’s not like you have any agency at all to influence her mood.  But one day she comes out and says it.  What feels like a lifetime ago, you sucked down a Star Scout homing beacon, and ever since you’ve been captured it’s been sending out pulses into the void.  Useless to attract help, but effective in creating an obnoxious ringing in her ear.  Because the Scouts are formed around the tenets of love and happiness, even her fae magic can’t just undo the signal.  So she just tries to live with it.  But eventually, the benefit of keeping you outweighs the annoyance.

All at once, you and your friends appear in a naked pile in the middle of a remote planet.  No gear, no equipment, no idea how long you’ve been gone, or how you’ll make your way back to civilization.  She doesn’t care - she just wants to put an end to the incessant ringing.  Then she vanishes in her signature puff of smoke, leaving your party to their own devices.

What follows is an exciting adventure in its own right, but it’s not the adventure we’re here to tell today.  And, regardless, your actions have led to failing your original mission.  Maybe next time you’ll think better about getting tangled up with a fae.

(if: $treetalk is true)[Instead, you just wonder why it was that the ‘helpful’ tree wanted to lead you into a trap.  Maybe your presence had disturbed it.  Maybe you were too loud, too disrespectful of the forest.  Or maybe it just thought it would be funny to doom you to a life of captivity at the hands of an, admittedly, super gorgeous spider-babe.  You have to admit, there are decidedly worse ways to get kidnapped.  And you should know, you’ve been kidnapped in practically every way imaginable.](else: )[Instead, you just wonder what these women are even doing here.  They can’t possibly be natives to this planet – during your briefing it had been made clear there was no sapient life present.  So then what?  Smugglers?  Pirates?  Why this planet?  Why now?  And… what are they going to do with you, now that they’ve got you.  The woman dragging you away provides no answers.]

Once she finds a good spot, she plops you down on the ground with your back against the cavern wall, then anchors you in place with more webbing.  You strain hard against the taut lines of silk, but don’t move an inch.  You’re not going anywhere.

“There we go,” she says brightly, poking your breast with a finger.  “The perfect bait.”

Bait?  Your heart sinks as you realize what the purpose of all this is.  She skitters over and sets down something on a rock right beneath you - your comm device.  You can see that she’s left a communication channel open, something that any of your friends would easily be able to trace, probably thinking you opened it on purpose to let them know where to find you.

“And now… we wait.  And five more delicious morsels will walk right into the kitchen.”

How could she know how many were on your crew for this mission?  Did she go through the data on your communicator?  (if: $treetalk is true)[Or… did the tree tell her that, too?](else: )[Did the other spider ladies do some recon to find out?]  You have no way to know.

Your captor stays close to you the whole time, occasionally occupying herself by groping and fondling your helpless body.  But eventually something seems to trigger her spider-senses, and she skitters off into the gloom to go hunting.  And then, twenty minutes later, she returns with two wriggling bundles, one slung over each arm.

Vhaja and Jyumon kick and buck, mewling into their gags, but only the faintest of moans escape the confines of the silk.  Just like you, you can tell all of their clothing has been peeled off beneath the webbing, the strands clinging firmly to the inviting contours of their bodies.  As much as you enjoy a bit of kinky web bondage, that’s a personal fetish, and not something you would willingly invite others to participate in without their consent.  Your friends had come to rescue you from a lifetime as the sexy spider’s plaything, and were captured themselves as a reward for their efforts.  It makes you feel like an absolute heel as the arachnid woman cheerily binds them in place nearby, tripling the yield of her catch.

Krysta is the next to show up.  She creeps through the gloom, stumbling upon your bound-up bodies.  And, thinking she’s about to play the hero, she pulls out her vibra-dagger, slinking toward you to cut your bonds - before a shadow descends from the cavernous ceiling and pins her to the ground.  A minute later and she’s mummified in silk like the rest of you.

Hearing her cry of surprise, Lumina glides out from the end of the cavern, cleric staff in hand, but she slams into a tangle of silk strewn across the pathway before even getting a single spell off.  The spider woman takes her time gleefully peeling away her clothing, forcing you all to watch as she toys with her angelic body.]

Once she’s had her fill, she bundles Lumina up just like the rest of you, suspending her in the center of the cavern.  She wriggles weakly - all of you do - but the bonds are effectively unbreakable when you’re all wrapped up so tightly.  The most any of you can do is moan into the silk covering your lips, straining uselessly against the impossibly firm restraints.  It’s clear this spider woman is no novice at her craft.  She always makes sure to anchor all of you in place with an excess of tethers, keeping you from squirming around to find some sharp edge to potentially cut a hole in the white dresses she’s woven for you all.

“Five down, one to go!” she says brightly, leaving Lumina swaying like a hammock as she goes off in search of her last target.

You’d like to think Revissa put up a fight.  That she got off a few spells, or maybe transformed into a bear and got a good claw slash right across the spider lady’s face.  It’s a nice fantasy.  Because it would mean that the six of you weren’t just helpless prey, that you were heroes who had gone on countless adventures across the galaxy, the kind of people they’d write stories about.  That’s a much more comforting thought than the image of your wife being pounced on from the shadows, stripped, bound, gagged and dragged off in an instant.  So, even when the spider lady comes into view, carrying her helplessly wriggling body, you imagine you just missed the epic confrontation happening right out of frame.

But whatever the truth of their encounter was, it doesn’t change the reality of the situation you all find yourselves in now.  Completely and utterly defeated, wrapped up so tightly you can’t possibly hope to escape.  

“There we are cuties, all of you snug as bugs.  It was nice of you all to come visit!”

She gets a chorus of muffled grunts from her collection of captives, but she ignores them as she lines you all up and glues you to the walls of the cave.]

“And don’t worry, we’ll take wonderful care of the lot of you.  After all, this is a remote planet, so we’ll need some entertainment to keep up morale…”

The six of you exchange glances, hoping someone’s expression holds some degree of confidence, a solution to the problem you’ve found yourselves in.  But there’s no such luck.  Each of you are equally helpless, and each of you is equally doomed to submit to the spider-lady’s advances.  With the whole crew caught, there’s no prospect for rescue in sight, making clear that the arrangement she’s chosen for you is going to be a long-term one.

Most people in the galaxy have heard of the Spider Queens, the ruthless warlords who travel the stars in their massive dreadnaughts, scooping up all the women in unprotected colonies to add them to their hordes of wiggling slaves.  Pure-blooded queens are towering warriors, with the lower body of bulbous spiders and the upper torso of a beautiful woman.  

Well, the ladies who have caught you all call themselves Spider Princesses - the half-breed offspring of queens.  Generally without political power in the hierarchy of the queens, they’ve been gathered together on this planet by the woman who captured all of you, a charismatic leader named Tula.  She wants to unite the scattered princesses and form their own coalition, using the natural resources of this planet as an economic weapon to cement her power.  The key to her plan is Ghost Matter, the material everything on the planet is made of.  When spider women consume fruits made of the stuff, their silk inherits its properties, making their webs both much stronger and much better at putting the women wrapped in them in permanent stasis.  But of course, to entice people to her cause, she has to offer them benefits – which come in the form of year-round, all-day access to as many webbed-up sex toys as they want.  You and your crew are just the first batch.

And so, as Tula’s power grows, more and more cocooned captives are brought in to line the walls of the caverns, helpless slaves who serve no purpose other than to slake the endless sexual hunger of their owners.  The six of you, strung up in a major thoroughfare of the cliffside caverns, are in high demand as stress relievers.  Rare is the day you get even an hour of alone time when you’re not being played with by an endless parade of beautifully possessive half-breed monarchs.

Needless to say, none of you are ever freed.  You exist now as nothing more than public-use stimulation fixtures, an important part of the infrastructure of a growing galactic power.

It is only by pure chance that you don’t spend the rest of your lives cocooned in the caves.  A good thirty years after your capture, a Star Scout squadron here for entirely unrelated reasons happens to pick up your distress beacon from the candy you ate at the start of the mission.  By now, the planet is a bustling trade hub with its own government, so they can’t just break you free in a commando raid.  Instead, they negotiate for your release with diplomacy, and secure a promise that Scout members and their crews will spend no more than a hundred years in captivity.  Which means you’ve all got another seventy years to go, but hey, it’s better than nothing.

At the very least, it leaves you plenty of time to think on what you could have done differently to not end up where you are now.

There’s been more than one occurrence where you and Revissa had to accomplish something entirely in the buff, but that usually only happened after you were kidnapped and needed to fight your way out of custody.

Revissa gets dressed first.  Her color scheme is a mixture of green, white and gold, a simple cloth shirt that shows off her cute tummy, a very low-cut skirt that would leave some sensitive areas exposed if not for the leaf adornment near the hips, some functional leg-wraps made of material harvested from plants, and a long scarf tied around the neck.  The ensemble is completed with some beautifully lacquered wooden jewelry polished to a golden sheen, including a moth emblem meant to show her devotion to the ancient forest guardian Un-Rama, a powerful fae spirit that protects her people.  Her long wooden staff bears the same symbol on its tip, making it the perfect conduit for her nature magic.

You take your time appreciating her before you bother getting your own outfit on.  For years you used to prefer purely functional clothing, but a long time ago on a mission you had gone in disguise under the made-up persona of the Dread Captain Wolfe, notorious space pirate, and to be honest you had really dug the aesthetic.  And so despite not actually having ever resorted to anything akin to piracy, you still like to sport the look, if for no other reason than as a personal ego boost.]

The outfit consists of some form-fitting pants that really accentuate your shapely bum, complete with a slit at the back for your poofy tail to fit through, and an equally clingy top that highlights both your chest size and your toned and muscular abdomen.  Belt buckles keep your tight leather boots firmly secured, while also providing a place to hang an equipment pouch and a blaster pistol on your hips.  A dashingly heroic cape hangs from your shoulders, but it also serves to conceal the heavy sword you also keep fastened there in a sheath along your back.

To be perfectly honest, you look damn good.  You’ve still got it!  Revissa rolls her eyes as you appreciate yourself in the mirror for a bit too long, before she finally grabs you by the arm and leads you out into the hallway so you can meet up with the rest of the crew.

[[Head to the bridge-&gt;P04]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="213" name="FC02" tags="" position="2375,875" size="100,100">You decide that it would be useful to investigate the potential of settlers or explorers here in the forest.  Both because it would give Revissa someone to be angry at other than you for a change, but also because whoever’s here might have some useful information that could help you on your journey.  

Veering off from the river, you follow an easily visible trail into the trees, walking for only about five minutes until the path opens up into a large clearing.  Here you find a half-dozen prefabricated living structures arranged in a semi-circle around a medium-sized cargo ship, maybe twice as big as your Lucky Break.  The ship is parked with its landing struts out, and you get the sense that it’s been there for at least a week or so, based on little details like how the loading ramp is arranged.  Off to one side you spy more of that resin that had been pooled up from the tree fitted with a faucet, though now it’s been hardened into huge chunks of opaque amber about as tall as a person, maybe six to ten of them all scattered around a massive flower.  Near the tree line you see some kind of equipment set up, probably meant for harvesting and packaging resources being gathered from the forest, since there are also a good deal of shipping crates piled up next to it.

Altogether, it does look very much like a smuggler’s camp.  And you can guess at the culprits based on the model of the cargo ship - a Knottie design.  From your briefing you know that the Knotties had established a camp near the ruins, but it looks like their operations have recently expanded towards the forest.  (if: $sawbunny is true)[Thinking back on it, you *had* seen some Knottie women entrapped by the psychic bunny in the central part of the forest, so it stands to reason this outpost is where they originated from.]  That said, you don’t see any of them currently milling about.  Maybe they’re on the ship or in one of the buildings, or perhaps just out working in the woods.

“I can’t believe they would treat this beautiful forest as nothing more than a source of raw materials!” Revissa says with an honestly kind of adorable pout.

In your head, you take note that Revissa seemed entirely unconcerned with them gathering resources when it was near the ruins - she only cares about it when trees and plants and forests are involved.  But you smartly bite your tongue, lest that pout be directed towards you, instead.

“Well… I guess we should have expected it,” you say diplomatically.  “There’s lots of stuff you can find in a forest to turn into bondage gear.  Vines, plant fibers, spider silk… even animal leather.  It was bound to happen sooner or later.”

“We need to drive them out!” Revissa firmly declares.

It takes you a few minutes to convince her that even if you *did* drive them out, it’s not like you’re planning on staying permanently on the planet to keep them away from the trees.  Better to just take note of it, and maybe bring it up with Krysta later as a point of discussion during her negotiations at their main camp.  

Either way, now that you’re here, you may as well take a look around.  The scent of pollen is thick in the air here, giving you a slight headache as you start to explore.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="214" name="FC03" tags="" position="1625,725" size="100,100">The tapping of the tree certainly poses an interesting mystery.  And you sympathize with Revissa’s anger at the situation.  But at the end of the day, you’re not here to solve all this planet’s problems, or to stick your nose into places it doesn’t belong.  What you need is to place these data collection devices and fulfill your mission.  Besides, once all the devices are in place, maybe the information gathered can help answer all these other questions as well.

Revissa is not entirely happy with your choice, but she goes along with it anyway.  But as you continue along the side of the river, she is constantly reaching out with her druidic senses, trying to connect with the various trees and plants around you.  It slows you down, but you know better than to interrupt her when she’s concentrating so strongly.  However, as you pass by a particularly thick cluster of tangled roots and vines, she stops completely.

“Are you okay?” you ask, gently walking up and laying a hand on her shoulder.

She shakes her head.  “No, I… I feel an intense presence in the forest.  It’s… alive.  But more than alive.  There’s a consciousness to it… and it is calling out to me…”

You raise an eyebrow.  Mysterious consciousnesses in the forest are not exactly the most reassuring thing to encounter on a ghost planet, and you tell her as much.

“I know…” she says distantly.  “But… I feel a deep… yearning from it, I suppose.  A loneliness.  I think… I should go to it.  See what it wants.  I’m a druid, I owe it that much.”

She leaves unsaid her annoyance that you did not let her follow up on her previous impulse.  And this time, she doesn’t wait for you to tell her otherwise.  She turns away from the side of the river and walks forcefully into the thick tangle of plants to the side, not even looking back.  You stand there for a moment, flabbergasted, at a loss for what to do next.

[[Let her go-&gt;FC03A]]
[[Stop her-&gt;FC03B]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="FC01A" tags="" position="1775,1025" size="100,100">Your desires are impossible to resist!  Just looking at Revissa fills you with an indescribable warmth, one which you are compelled to satisfy in the only way you know how.  Almost without realizing it, you pounce, pushing your wife to the ground and pawing at her clothing, tearing fabric and sending boots flying every which way.

At first, she tries to keep her composure, push you away.  But after the first love bite on her exposed shoulder, she mewls with delight and closes her eyes, leaning in against you.

“That pollen… from before…” she mutters between gasps.  “It must have… been some sort of… slow-acting aphrodisiac…”

Her explanation falls on deaf ears.  Because the only sound you are searching for right now are passionate moans and delighted squeals.  And so you get to work on eliciting those beautiful noises, subjecting Revissa to all of your most effective love-making techniques.  She melts in your arms, falling to her knees as your hands satisfy every inch of her yearning skin.  And at one point, her pleasure is so great that she screams in ecstasy, unintentionally channeling some of her nature magic to cause the ground to rumble and the trees around you to spread their roots even more deeply.

In the long run, that will make the plants in the area stronger and healthier, more resistant to the weather.  But in the short term, it has a different effect.  Namely, causing the nearby tree with the faucet valve on it to erupt with life, causing a spray of glistening amber to burst out from the spigot right above the two of you.

Perhaps it would have been a good idea to spend some time investigating the properties of the honey-sweet sap, because if you had, you’d have found it remains a liquid for only a few seconds after being exposed to the air, before quickly hardening into a thick, impenetrable resin.  The two of you only have a moment to react with surprise before a globule of the amber has fully washed over you, forming a hunk of quick-drying honey that has encased your bodies from head to toe.

(link:&quot;Harden&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

(set: $picF47 to true)

To be fair, the sensations are indescribable.  The scent of honey does not just fill your nostrils, it permeates your entire being, a heavenly sweetness that prompts an explosion of erotic surrations through your skin, your muscles, through every nerve ending.  And as it hardens into a glistening, translucent rock of unbreakable resin, you can only surrender to the torrent of orgasmic bliss that washes over you, a hundred times more potent than the best sex you’ve ever had in your life.

At this point, you can’t move.  You can’t breathe, though that doesn’t seem to matter.  You can vaguely perceive light shining in through the hunk of amber, but your mind isn’t in a state to really process it.  Because the sensations of pleasure do not abate.  Instead, they fill up to bursting, the most intensely erotic joy you’ve ever had.  And whether you like it or not, it doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to stop.

But all of that hardly seems to matter.

The only thing that matters to you is the pleasure.  Day in and day out, that is your entire world, a thrumming intensity of sensation that never abates.  Your mind becomes consumed by it, your body turning into nothing but a conduit of pure stimulation, every ounce of your being focused on the constantly churning tsunami of sexual buildup.  There’s never any release to it, no downhill trajectory, no moment to catch your breath.  Everything is pleasure, to the exclusion of anything else.

Presumably, your crew is still out there somewhere.  Maybe they got caught by some other peril on the planet, or maybe they were forced to abandon it after weeks of searching.  There’s no way to know.  The only thing that’s certain is that no one ever finds you, no one ever arrives to put an end to your eternal happiness.  Though, to be fair, with your mental state as it is, you’d never choose anything other than remaining right here, forever.

There’s never any release to it, no downhill trajectory, no moment to catch your breath.  Everything is pleasure, to the exclusion of anything else.

In the coming years, you’ll thank your friends for locking on to the Star Scout homing beacon and salvaging your sap-frozen bodies from the forest.  You’ll appreciate them traveling all the way to Del Thora, and meeting with the Squira druids there who were able to devise a technique to thaw out your amber prisons.  Because without their expertise, the sap would otherwise have proven to be indestructible.  But the moment after your release, you’re only capable of finally riding out the end of the orgasm that had been building up for days, and in the ensuing months of recovery all you’re able to wish for is to be trapped again, to be able to experience that pleasure all over again.

You’ll be in rehab for years learning to deal with the withdrawal symptoms, but eventually the two of you will recover.  But what you won’t ever get back is the chance to complete the mission, which thanks to your slip-up has resulted in a resounding failure.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="218" name="FC03A" tags="" position="1625,875" size="100,100">In the end, who are you to stop her?  Your wife is a child of the trees, a guardian of nature.  If there is some kind of plant-based emergency happening, she’s the one who should be taking care of it.  And so you just stand back and watch as she slides out of her clothing, neatly folding it into a pile, then sets her staff down on top of it.  A sight that might have been surprising, but this is not the first time you’ve seen her want to be completely *au naturel* when communing with her environment.  Something about wanting nothing between herself and the world, being totally without artifice or the touch of civilization about her.

You maintain a respectable distance as she walks, cursing and muttering as your feet get stuck in knotted clumps of roots and your skin gets pricked by thorny brambles.  Revissa, in contrast, seems entirely unmolested by the difficult terrain, easily making it to the base of a massive tree deep into the tangle of plant life.  She has a dreamy smile on her face as she closes her eyes and meditates, standing still as stone atop a thick patch of moss.

At first, you think everything is working as intended.  You’ve seen her commune with nature plenty of times before.  But then you feel a prickle in the back of your mind, your instincts telling you something is not right with this situation.  And that’s when you see it.  From within the moss beneath Revissa’s feet, a thick sheet of plant matter begins to extend, creeping up her body and molding itself against her skin.  Druid or not, there’s no way Revissa would let that happen to herself if she were in her right mind.  Something sinister is happening here, and you need to stop it!

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="219" name="FC03B" tags="" position="1625,600" size="100,100">“Hey… wait a second,” you say, running after her through the tangle.  

It’s a lot harder for you than it is for her - you get scratched by brambles and tripped up by roots, while Revissa seems unmolested by the rigors of the difficult terrain.  When you finally manage to catch up you’re fully out of breath, wheezing as you lay a hand on her shoulder.

“Come on… don’t just run off like this,” you say.  “It could be dangerous.”

Revissa turns and looks at you with a distant expression on her face, showing a detachment that makes your blood run cold.  

“The dangerous thing… would be to ignore it…” she murmurs, before pulling away and continuing her walk.

Okay, now you’re *sure* something’s wrong.  This time, when you catch up with her again, you grip her wrist firmly and tug, yanking her away from whatever it is she’s trying to get to.

(if: $faewin is true)[“Revissa!  Get a hold of yourself!” you yell.  “This is obviously a trap!  Maybe the fae woman is messing with us again!”

That seems to get through to her.  She blinks fiercely, trying to get a hold of her senses.

“Damned… fae…” she mutters.  But whatever has gripped her mind isn’t letting go.  Even as she realizes the peril she is in, her eyes turn towards the place she is being lured towards.  “I… I can’t… resist it…”

It’s clear now she’s being manipulated.  Something is controlling her mind.  And you’ve got to stop her before she throws herself into whatever trap is waiting for her.

[[Physically restrain her-&gt;FC03BB]]

A twitch of her staff summons some leafy vines to wrap around you and pull you to the forest floor, leaving you stuck as she walks with renewed vigor towards whatever fate the forest has in store for her.

By the time you manage to pull yourself free, she’s already nearly out of sight!

]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="220" name="FC03AA" tags="" position="1775,875" size="100,100">“Revissa!”

You yell out her name, trying to get her attention.  But your wife remains completely under the spell of the insidious plants, stuck in her own little world.  And the fleshy green plant matter continues to spread upwards, forming a tight sheath around her naked body.  Her legs are cinched together, arms forced to her sides as the material presses over her breasts, quickly advancing towards her face.

“Revissa!  Wake up!”

But she doesn’t hear you.  In a moment, she’s going to be entirely consumed!

[[Attack the plants-&gt;FC03AB]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="221" name="FC03AB" tags="" position="1925,875" size="100,100">You don’t know what, exactly, these plans have in store for her, but you know it can’t be good.  And so, despite what Revissa always says about protecting nature, you figure it’s time to do a little bit of… gardening.

Reaching for your sword at your back, you pull out the blade and start swinging, slicing at the roots and vines getting in your way, desperately trying to close the distance to her.  And yet despite the ferocity of your assault, Revissa remains entrapped by the strange plant matter threatening to envelop her.  Between sword strikes, you watch as her restrained body is consumed by the tight sheathe of living material, flowing past her shoulders and over her neck, threatening to consume her face.

You just aren’t fast enough.  By the time you make it to her side Revissa has been entirely encased by the plants.  A single vine has tightened around her waist to keep her arms pinned, then curled upwards to hold her neck in place, allowing the tip of it to press itself between her lips.  You can only imagine what it plans on doing with her in that state.

“Let her go!” you scream, winding up your sword to try and sever the tendrils keeping hold of her.

But before you make the swing, you feel something grab hold of your legs.  Looking down, you find more of that plant matter has caught hold of you - and is starting to creep up your body!

Frantically, you try to peel it off using the edge of your sword, but it advances faster than you’re able to remove it.  As it goes, some kind of liquid seeping out from the plant starts sizzling against your skin, not doing any damage other than to dissolve away your clothing.  And then to make matters worse, you feel vines begin to curl around your body, snagging your arms and pressing them to your sides.  Your sword is pulled away as the plant matter pushes upwards, anchoring your limbs in place and preventing you from making any headway in escaping.  And then, just like what happened to Revissa, a tendril winds around your neck to hold your head in place, allowing it to insert its tip right between your lips.

Despite your best efforts, you’ve been caught.  Revissa is completely encased alongside you, helpless in the way you’re only moments away from becoming.  You can feel the tip of the vine pulsate and throb, before it releases a sweet-smelling nectar down your throat.  And then… all your troubles start to melt away.

The tension fades from your limbs.  The anxiety flees from your mind.  Eyes and ears stop bothering to tell you about the world around you.  Because now, all that matters is the sweetness of the sap that flows through your body.  You don’t even notice as the plant matter finishes its advance, encasing you from head to toe.  And you no longer worry about the health and safety of your wife, contained in the sheath next to you.  You understand now why she volunteered for this.  Because all she wanted was to become part of it, merge with something grander and greater than herself.  You and she are now a part of the forest, connected to a vast, thriving network of infinite beauty.  Yes, you might have surrendered your freedom, your mobility, your sense of self, your very future, but in exchange you know you’ll never have to worry about anything again.

All you need to do is sit here and submit to it, offer your body as yet another organ for the vast ecosystem that surrounds you.

You shout directly into her ear, but still she does not hear you.  And now you can feel that same plant matter taking hold of your legs, forming a thick second skin.  In a moment you’ll be trapped too!  But you can’t give up.  Revissa is a druid, a steward of nature - she’s not someone who should get helplessly overcome by some common plants!  You just need her to remind her of who she is.

But if words won’t reach her, maybe your emotions will.  By now, the plant matter has crept up to her neck, threatening to consume her face.  But before it does, you clasp your hands around her cheeks and pull head in closer, locking lips with her for a long, passionate kiss.  And as you pull away, her eyes finally shoot open in recognition.

“Melfy?  What was I do—” she begins, before a vine twists out from the cluster of plant matter and wraps around her lips.  Her cry of surprise is muffled entirely, before the green sheathe completely covers her head

Damnit!  You were so close!  But now all you can do is watch as Revissa is pulled away from you, and more and more vines begin springing up to wrap themselves around your own body.  You wanted to save her, but all you managed to do was get caught yourself.  Tighter and tighter they squeeze you, cutting off any chance to resist, arranging you in the same position as Revissa is as your own legs become consumed with the layer of plant-like growth.  

Is this the end for both of you?  You can’t even muster up the strength to struggle as you feel something twist itself around your mouth.  It’s so impossibly tight, you feel like you can hardly breathe.  All that’s left to do is close your eyes and accept your fate…

…
…
…

“Melfy!”

You’re brought back to reality by the desperate sound of your wife’s voice.  Opening your eyes, you see that she’s managed to somehow coax the plants away from her face, but they still have her tightly bound from the waist downwards.

“Fight it!” she yells.  “I’m not strong enough to do more than loosen its hold!”

You can see from her face that she’s concentrating with as much force as she can muster, using her connection to nature to manipulate the plants that are holding you.  She’s given you a chance, and nothing more - but that’s all that you need!

At most, plants just react.  Bending towards a patch of sunlight, dropping their leaves when the weather gets cold, spreading roots deeper and deeper into the soil in search of nutrients.

Of course, as part of a plant, you are already helping fulfill one of those tasks.  Because as it turns out, the body of an intelligent being is capable of providing many intangible benefits to a thriving floral ecosystem.  It could be described as a symbiotic relationship.  The plant matter encases your body, the nectar it provides regulates all your essential biological systems, keeps you functioning in all the ways that matter to it, even if your mind has been essentially dulled into sleepy compliance.  In exchange, you provide a highly potent spiritual energy to your host, a form of nutrient that it couldn’t find anywhere else.  Your very soul nourishes the forest around you, allows the plants to spread ever further, become even more resilient to external threats.

If Revissa were conscious and aware, she could describe it to you better.  She could explain in intricate detail how the two of you have been inextricably merged with the forest, how your entrapped minds allow everything else to thrive.  But of course, she can’t speak a word, because she, like you, is now just an aspect of something much greater.

Thanks to the ghost matter everything on the planet is made of, your bodies never need any further maintenance, not even from the ravages of time.  You don’t age a day in your new, chlorophyll filled prisons, don’t grow sick or hungry or cold.  To you, every day is the same, every moment an opportunity to provide more of yourself to your host.

No one ever comes to find you.  You have no way of knowing, or caring, what became of the rest of your crew.  Maybe they succumbed to some other peril on the planet, or maybe they spent weeks trying to find you before being forced to leave.  It doesn’t matter.  Nothing does.  Day in, day out, you simply continue to function towards your new purpose.  And unlike your old mission, at this one, you manage to succeed.

Many days later, Revissa will explain it to you better.  She’ll go over the exact ways in which your bodies were being used.  Most of it will go over your head.  But what you’ll remember is the way you felt, how relaxed you were, how connected with the world around you.

It takes nearly a week for the rest of your crew to track down your bodies.  They were following the homing beacon sent out by the Star Scout candy you swallowed at the start of the mission, but the readings were faint, since you barely had any ego left in you after the plant’s nectar dulled your mind.  But they did find you, and they did manage to cut you free.

Now the two of you are resting on a bed back on your ship, beginning the long, arduous process of rejoining the world of mammals after spending so much time as a plant.  Sadly, as a result, you’ve failed your mission, the data collection device destroyed during your time in captivity.  In a way, perhaps you’ll long for the time you didn’t have to think, because now you’ll never be able to stop dwelling on all the mistakes you made to end up here.

GAME OVER

[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="225" name="FC03C" tags="" position="1925,725" size="100,100">It doesn’t come up as often as it should, but the fact remains that you’re a physical powerhouse.  Maybe not legendarily strong, but you can arm wrestle an orc and come away without any broken limbs, and that’s something most women can’t boast about.  

The key thing is leverage.  You’ve been tied up enough times to know that it doesn’t matter how strong you are if your points of articulation are cut off in the right ways.  Which is why it’s so important that Revissa managed to loosen just a few of the vines.  Because even though you’re still tied up, you now have mobility in the places that matter.  And you use that mobility to its fullest extent, reaching down and grabbing hold of the tendrils trying to wrap you up, yanking one away from your face as it tries to jam itself down your throat.

“Not today!” you yell with a snarl, taking hold of two opposite ends of the vines and snapping them apart with brute strength.  

After that, you reach down and snag the ends of the sheath of plant matter creeping up your body, pulling it down as if you were wiggling out of a particularly tight pair of pants.  You can feel it start to tear, not having been built to sustain so much force at this angle of movement.  Now almost entirely free, you prepare for one last tug to rip away the last of the vines, but get distracted at the last possible moment as the tip of one of the plants inserts itself in the slit between your legs.

“Guaaaaghhh~~” you shriek, starting as a howl of surprise but giving away to a mewl of pleasure.

One single distraction was all the plant needed to recapture you.  By now your clothing has been torn to bits, your naked body twitching with erotic stimulation as the vines has its way with you.  More tendrils snap around your arms, anchoring them behind your back, binding up your wrists and holding them firmly in place, as your entire body is tipped over and flops down to the ground.  Your legs get cinched together, locking the one probing vine in place inside of you, as another curls around your neck then inserts itself into your mouth.

And at this point, you’re helpless and defeated.  You can only squirm weakly as the sheath of plant matter reforms itself, creeping up your legs, over your butt and tail, consuming your chest, your neck, and finally your face.  The fluffy ears on the top of your head are the last to touch fresh air before you’re entirely sealed off, completely and utterly restrained.  Sweet nectar pours from the vine jammed between your lips, flowing down your throat and sending your mind into a dreamy, erotic haze, priming your body for an intense orgasm as the tendril between your legs continues its stimulating assault.

Well, you tried your best.  You gave it your all, but in the end, you were nothing more than a snack for a hungry plant.  All you can do is twitch and buck helplessly, writhing as you are brought to several overwhelming climaxes.  There’s nothing you can do but submit to your fate.  It seems like you’re destined for a life as plant food.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="226" name="FC03BA" tags="" position="1775,600" size="100,100">You race towards your wife with all the speed you can muster, eventually bursting out through a tangle of thickets to emerge into a small clearing encircling a massive tree.  Its thick trunk is wider than you are tall, its branches forming a canopy over the area that nearly blots out the sun.  Revissa steps mindlessly in front of it, having cast off her clothing and set down her staff such that she is naked as she moves into position.

“Revissa!”

You call out desperately, but she’s too far gone.  The terrifying pull of these cursed plants have completely dominated her mind, commanding her to stand blankly at attention as some kind of thick green membrane begins pulling itself over her legs.  The material is made entirely out of plant matter, forming a skin-tight sheath that snugly hugs the contours of her figure.  Her legs are pressed together, her arms cinched against her side as it keeps climbing, threatening to completely encase her.  

There’s only a moment before she’s entirely consumed, so you’ll have to act fast!

[[Attack the plants-&gt;FC03AB]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="227" name="FC03BB" tags="" position="1925,475" size="100,100">If the allure of the plants is too much for her, then you’re not left with much choice.  You’re going to have to first make sure Revissa stays put before you actually get around to working on the problem.  And so, while she’s still cogent enough to realize you’re trying to help her, you grab her by the shoulders and push her down onto the ground.

“Okay… I’m gonna have to tie you down,” you say to her slowly.  “I need to be sure you’re not going to run off again before I go trying to take out whatever the source of this is.”

She is straining with all her might just to listen to your words, but she manages to force herself to nod in agreement.  And so, that settled on, you look around for anything to use to tie her up.  Thankfully, not too far away you spy some thick, green plant vines laying on the forest floor beside a giant flower with huge petals spreading out around it that are easily six feet long.  That should do quite nicely!

In retrospect, you really should have seen what was coming.  Though in your defense, you were a bit distracted trying to rescue your wife.  Either way, as soon as you give one of those vines a tug, your mistake becomes apparent.  Because the vines are attached to that giant plant, and that giant plant has been waiting for ages to chomp down on a snack as tasty as you are.

And so, when you tug on the vine, it tugs right back on you, and before you know it you’ve been yanked into the center of the plant’s petals.  As preoccupied as you were with Revissa, it did not even occur to you that the plant might have fought back, and so you are totally disoriented as the leaves wrap around you and a cloud of pollen swirls in the air, filling your nostrils with an intoxicatingly sweet aroma.

After that… everything is sort of a haze.  You’re aware of some kind of fleshy pink tendril wrapping around your body, helping you discard your clothing and weapons.  None of that seems particularly important anymore.  Useless, really.  After all, these leaves are the only covering you’ll ever need!

You’re also aware of Revissa getting up from the ground and walking into the plant-mouth together with you, her clothing left behind on the forest floor.  Already entranced by the siren song of the wood’s magic, the pollen isn’t even necessary to gain her compliance.  She steps in willingly, taking her place beside you as the pink elastic plant stalk begins to wrap itself around the two of you, holding your limbs tightly and pressing in against your lips.  Now even if you wanted to, you’d be unable to call for help… not that there’s anyone nearby to hear you anyway.

And so, the two of you stand there, helplessly compliant, as the plant begins to fold its massive leaves around its prey, happy to have finally found a meal that will be sure to keep it satisfied for a long, long time.

“Revissa… I need you to use your shapeshifting magic.  Transform into something small and portable, okay?  I’m gonna get you out of here, I promise!”

It’s clear she is using all of her willpower just to stop herself from moving.  Does she even have enough left in the tank to do any magic?

“I…” she says, clearly struggling.  “I… can’t…”

“Being small won’t impact your ability to get to where you need to go, right?” you say soothingly.  The trick to overcoming mental compulsion is to offer alternatives reasonable to the goals that are being forced on the victim.

She spends a moment considering that, but eventually nods.

“So why don’t you turn yourself into a cute little mouse, okay?  And then I’ll let you go.”

Another nod.  And then she closes her eyes, draws from the wellspring of natural energy around her to activate her shapeshifting magic.  Her body starts to shrink, green fur sprouts from her skin, whiskers growing from her cheeks as her nose becomes all cute and twitchy.  

Just like that, she’s become an adorable little mouse, and immediately starts to scamper towards a deeper section of the forest.  But you’re not a wolf for nothing.  Predator instincts kick in, and you dive towards your transformed wife, catching her not with your hands but your jaws, chomping down on her soft green fur.  Of course, you don’t actually bite down.  For one, you have no desire to hurt her, but for two if you did too much damage the spell keeping her in this form would be broken and she’d revert to her natural state.

So instead, you scoop her up into your arms, pulling the flailing mouse close to your chest.  And then you turn and run, trying to make it back to the river before her addled mind realizes she can change into something bigger and stronger to escape your grip.  Leaves and vines, thorns and brambles spring up around the ground to try and stop you, and branches of trees bend to block your path, but you barrel through all of them, intent only on protecting the woman you love.  

When you finally see the river you don’t stop running, instead diving straight in with a colossal splash.  As the sound of rushing water fills your ears you pull your mouse-wife in even closer, just trying to keep both your heads above water as the current sweeps you downstream.

Several minutes later, the two of you emerge, drenched and exhausted, and throw yourselves onto the shore.  Revissa is back in humanoid form, and also seems to have regained control of her mind.  Pulling out your holo-map, you find you’ve basically lost all the progress you’ve made up until this point, having been carried back nearly to the entrance of the forest.

Revissa leans over and kisses you, thanking you for the rescue.  And together you both decide mind-altering plants are not worth the trouble.  Instead of following the river, you’ll double back to the start and find a different route to your destination.  

[[Return to the start-&gt;FA06]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="229" name="FC03BD" tags="" position="1625,450" size="100,100">“Hold on,” you say, pressing down firmly on her shoulders.  “I’m gonna find whatever is controlling you and get rid of it!  Just stay here.”

Revissa looks at you with bleary eyes, but nods slowly.  It’s clear it is taking all her willpower to resist whatever has its hold on her.  After you help her sit down against a tree, you run off into the woods, searching for anything that looks out of place.  Though… as you wander, you realize you don’t actually know what you’re looking for.  After five minutes pass without you seeing anything noteworthy, panic starts to set in.  What were you doing, leaving Revissa alone?

So you turn and double back, looking for the tree where you left her.  But try as you might, you don’t see her!  Now fully frantic, you search the ground for tracks, finding evidence of her footsteps moving off in a direction opposite the one you had run down.  Quick as you can, you follow them, finally catching sight of her silhouette walking in a hypnotic daze towards a clearing.

[[Catch up with her-&gt;FC03BA]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="230" name="FC03BX" tags="" position="2075,475" size="100,100">The interior of the plant is warm and wet, filled with an indescribable sweetness.  You put up no resistance as the fleshy stalk wraps ever more tightly around you, pressing you and your wife together into a deeply intimate embrace.  Your lips encircle hers without any thought crossing your mind, and your legs spread open as the tips of the plant stalks insert themselves into your unprotesting nether regions.

Both of you coo in delight as you’re brought to the first of many overpowering climaxes, kissing each other deeply as your new floral home keeps you happy and stimulated.  You have no way of knowing what, exactly, the plant wants from you, but apparently you have something to offer it, because now that it has you, it folds up into itself to form a thick, bulb-like carapace that prevents anything outside from getting in.  And then, the bulb digs itself into the ground, retreating beneath the soil so that nothing can get at the two bodies entwined in its symbiotic hold.

Over the years, you and Revissa contribute to the plant’s growth, helping it to spread its roots far across the forest, allowing it to create a thriving network of interconnected organisms.  The two of you, trapped in your subterranean bulb, are the nexus of all the new development, your mental energies somehow harvested to keep everything neatly organized.  Of course, the two of you are never consciously aware of it.  For the endless years ahead of you, you both experience nothing but happiness, awash with the constant stimulation your bodies provide to one another.  You’ll never know fear, or pain, or hunger, or unhappiness again, nor will your bodies age or decay.  In a way, you’ve become eternal, an unchanging fixture of the forest that will always be there for you.

At this point, even if you could leave, you wouldn’t want to.  But, of course, the fact remains that you *can’t* leave.  And you never will.

Luckily for you, hiding itself is the only major defense it has.  Because even though there’s no external indicator of where you’ve been buried, the Star Scout homing beacon candy you swallowed at the start of the mission still broadcasts your location to your allies.  It takes several days, but they do eventually find you, and manage to dig you up from the ground - destroying the plant that caught you and many others in the forest in the meantime.  When she wakes up, Revissa makes a token objection to the needless violence against nature, but even she has to admit it is preferable to spending the rest of her life as fertilizer.

Unfortunately, the data collection device you were entrusted with was destroyed in the confusion, meaning your mission was ultimately a failure.  But at least you’ve escaped with your body and mind intact.  Though maybe from now on, you’ll be a bit more hesitant the next time your wife asks you to help her with the gardening.
 
[[Start Over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="232" name="FC03CA" tags="" position="2075,725" size="100,100">You lose track of time as the plant has its way with you.  As far as you know, it could have been hours.  Time loses all meaning in the face of the pleasure you’re being subjected to.  But eventually the sensations subside, and suddenly you find yourself being ejected, spat out from the mouth of the plant like a cat coughing up a hairball. 

Now you’re splayed out on the forest floor, naked and exhausted, sitting in a pool of fragrant plant sap.  Revissa is standing above you and quickly takes your hand, pulling you to your feet.  She pops a berry between your lips, the kind she grows with her magic to restore stamina, and you feel a rush of strength return to your limbs.

“Come on, we need to get out of here,” she says, tugging on your arm.

You have just enough presence of mind to grab your pouch full of equipment before the two of you run back towards the river.  Everything is still a blur, your body aching from all the stimulation, your mind in a euphoric fog, but the tightness of Revissa’s grip on your hand is something to focus on as you make your retreat.  When you finally reach the river, the two of you collapse into each other’s arms, panting with both relief and fatigue.

When you catch your breath, Revissa explains that she was able to use her nature magic to command the plants to release you - but she only had the time to focus thanks to you causing all that damage before you were captured.  On the one hand, you’re glad your strength proved to be useful, though on the other, some small part of you wished you could have actually gotten to be the big hero for once.  You never actually get to look cool on your adventures, and it kind of bums you out.

But at least you’re both still alive and not trapped inside of a hungry plant.  Though you both lost your clothing and gear, you at least managed to grab your supply pouch, so the data collection device you need for the mission is safe.  And some of the matter resynthesizer capsules Jyumon provided you with allows you to provide replacements for everything else you lost.  After a few minutes, you’re both equipped and ready to go - though now there’s the question of which direction to head in.

Obviously, you could continue forward for your mission.  But at this point, it might be worth doubling back to check out that settlement you passed.  If the plants are this aggressive out here, it could be useful to find out how these other visitors managed to avoid getting caught by them.  Alternatively, you could just give up on this route entirely and try a different path to get through the forest.

Learning about plants is secondary.  And to be honest, at this point you’re anxious to get out of here anyway, lest you become a snack for another hungry flower.  And so you push forward, continuing along the path of the river towards the destination on your map.

Thankfully, you make it an hour without any further interruptions.  Revissa is careful not to do any more communing with nature, and you keep your eyes peeled for any signs of creeping vines or pollen-spitting bulbs.]

Eventually, you reach the point where you need to branch off from the river, and to your relief, the only thing in your way is a large, open, grassy patch of land, no trees, flowers, or bushes in sight - there’s not even any large rocks or other obstructions for a predator to hide behind.  In such a wide, clear area, you feel like there’s no chance of getting taken by surprise.

In retrospect, you should have foreseen the problem.  Together, you and Revissa begin marching across the open plain, eyes darting warily back and forth - towards the distant trees, towards the river behind you, towards the sky above - everywhere but down at your feet.  If you had looked that way, you might have noticed the ominous way the blades of grass shifted as you walked over them, swaying not in sync with the direction of the wind but their own internal chemistry.  How every strand bent towards the intruders in their territory, how the two of you were not welcome, even here, in an open, unassuming stretch of land.

The grass waits until the two of you are far into the center of the patch of green, when you stop for a moment to pull off your boot to shake out a pebble that had gotten stuck.  It is the very moment that the rock strikes the ground that the grass begins to sway, suddenly growing in length and spooling outwards with a mind all its own.  In an instant your legs have been wrenched together, throwing you off balance and making you drop your boot onto the ground.  More blades of grass twirl upwards to ensnare and destroy the foreign object, turning it into tiny scraps that are swiftly buried beneath the soil.  As if the grass wants to cover up any trace of your existence.

Beside you, Revissa shrieks in surprise as she, too, is targeted, her staff yanked from her hand and dropped with a soft thunk onto the soft green surface beneath her.  Your instinct is to reach out towards her, but the growing coils of flora capture your arm and pull it against your body, shredding any clothing it catches along the way.  Now realizing the peril the two of you are in, your wife tries to close her eyes and use her magic to connect with the grass trying to entrap you, but all she gets is a terrifying, violent impulse to subjugate all that does not belong.  She comes out of her trance with a gasp, just as the grass curls past her chin and over her mouth to seal away her voice.

And just like that, the two of you are caught.  The grass blades form impossibly tight, intensely sturdy bands of material, wrapping you up like you were a pair of mummies.  You can’t move a muscle, can’t make a noise, can’t possibly escape as it coils itself more and more firmly around your bodies.  And once it is sure you’re completely at its mercy, the grass yanks you downwards, slamming your wrapped forms against the soil.  Now you can only wriggle about like worms, but even that is taken away from you as additional tethers snake out to anchor you both in place, forcing you to look upwards towards the sky.

The two of you make helpless, plaintive mewling noises into the gags that have covered your lips, but they are barely audible against the gentle sound of grass swaying in the wind.  You’ve both been pulled down so low, restrained so snugly, that from a distance you wouldn’t even be visible against the endless sea of green, aside from maybe a tiny flash of yellow hair.  Side by side the two of you lay, utterly immobilized, capable of doing nothing but staring upwards at the bright warm rays of a sun that seems to taunt you with its freedom.

Paradoxically, despite the grass’s hatred of foreign intrusion, it seems that it has answered the problem by making sure the both of you stay here for a long, long time.  And, trapped as you are, there’s nothing you can do but lay here and wait to see what happens next.

For several minutes you walk, keeping your eyes peeled for any signs of danger, but it seems the plants are no longer calling out to your wife with their siren song of togetherness.  And so, after a long stretch of tension, you finally let yourself relax, slowing your pace to normal and sparing a glance towards your map readout to figure out the next route you’ll try to take.

Unfortunately, it is at the exact moment that you first let your guard down that you feel the rumble of movement from beneath the soil, followed by the eruption of several hidden creeper vines that dart upwards and wrap themselves around your limbs.

Look up at the sky and imagine being as free as the clouds that lazily drift by on the wind.  But instead you’re here, wrapped up in bandages made of grass and firmly tied to the earth.  Escape is impossible, the prospect of rescue your only hope.  But as the days go by, it becomes clear that no one is coming to save you.

You’ll never know what happened to the rest of the crew.  Maybe something else on this planet snatched them up.  Or maybe they tried, and failed, to find the two of you, spent weeks searching before being forced to give up and leave in defeat.  It’s impossible to tell one way or the other.  Because the only information you have available to you is what you see in the sky above, and the clouds aren’t very talkative.

And so the days pass, you and Revissa wrapped up side by side, held taut by the hateful strength of innumerable blades of grass.  Because everything on this planet is made of ghost matter, there’s no need for the verdant tendrils to tend to your needs, to worry about giving you food or water.  Though you get plenty of the latter whenever it happens to rain.

You used to always wish you had more time to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the world moving on around you.  Well, lucky for you, you’ve finally gotten that wish.  And even better, you’ll continue to be able to live out that fantasy, now and forever.

Look up at the sky and imagine being as free as the clouds that lazily drift by on the wind.  But instead you’re here, wrapped up in bandages made of grass and firmly tied to the earth.  Escape is impossible, the prospect of rescue your only hope.  As the hours drift on by, you find your mind drifting away, lazily following the movements in the sky.

Which is why you notice the familiar silhouette of your ship the Lucky Break coming in from the east.  It lands on the wide patch of grass and lowers a loading ramp for your allies to come out in search for you.  The grassy deathtrap tries its best to capture them all and consume the ship as well, but a fireball spell from Jyumon releases its hold on them and teaches the meadow there are worse things than unwanted feet trampling the grass.  

Unfortunately, even though they do manage to save you, the data collection device was destroyed in the scuffle.  And without it, the mission is impossible to complete.  So you are forced to leave the planet with your tail between your legs, free and healthy, but with a terrible fear of grass that will make you unable to ever mow a lawn again.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="237" name="FA06A" tags="" position="1400,975" size="100,100">You slide against a tree as you bring up the holo-map on your comm device, trying to figure out some other way to get to the other side of the forest.  At this point, you’re half-considering heading back to your ship and seeing if you can’t rig up some kind of parachute system for a fly-over.  Because no matter how you slice it, you can’t see another viable path.

Eventually you groan in annoyance, flicking off the map display to see if Revissa has any other ideas.  But as you look around, you’re surprised to find that she’s nowhere in sight.

“Revissa?”

You call out for her, hoping she’s just wandered off again to inspect some interesting flowers.  But you don’t get any reply.

Now your heart starts pounding in your chest.  You were only distracted for a few minutes.  There’s no way she’s gone so far in that short amount of time that she wouldn’t even be able to hear you.

“Revissa!!”

This time you yell as loudly as you can, scaring some birds away from branches on a nearby tree.  Still nothing.

Where could she have gone?  Is she hurt?  Is she hiding?  Or worse, did one of the many terrible dangers you’ve encountered in these blasted woods snatch her up?

Now you start moving frantically, poking your head between trees, searching the ground for tracks, checking for any snapped twigs that might indicate a path someone took to leave the area.  But you can’t find anything.  So you increase your search radius, moving out of the small clearing you’d been waiting in, checking for any signs of life at all.  It’s only after a solid ten minutes that you finally notice something, not with your eyes, but your ears.

It’s a soft sound, barely audible, hardly more than a whisper, but you hear it.  It’s the sound of someone’s voice, grunting and moaning.  As fast as you’re able, you rush towards the noise, pushing past a tight cluster of tangled brambles to emerge in front of a large tree.  You’re sure the sound came from here.  And in fact, you can still hear it.  But where’s its source?  Looking around, you eventually notice something out of place on the ground near the tree’s base, so you move over to look.

What you find are torn bits of cloth.  *Familiar* cloth.  White and gold and green, and a little lacquered wooden moth emblem, the symbol of Un-Rama, the forest spirit Revissa worships.  It’s your wife’s clothing!  But if that’s here, then where is she?

At this point, two things happen in quick succession.  The first is that you look up, and finally discover the source of the noise.  Your wife is there, suspended between the upper branches of the trees, completely naked, save for the tight reams of spider silk expertly woven around her shapely figure.  It’s so snug it’s practically a second layer of skin, accenting her lovely curves in a way that would be deeply erotic if you had a chance to appreciate it.  The reason her voice was so muffled was the ball-shaped gag of webbing forced between her lips, sealing off anything other than a few plaintive grunts.  As you make eye contact with her, she looks down at you desperately, pupils darting furiously towards the second thing that happens.

It’s over so quickly, you barely even have time to process it.  All you see are four dark shapes creeping past your peripheral vision - a set of spindly black spider legs.  Each of them has a stringy length of silk dangling from the tip, and as they curl around you in unison each of them finds a part of your body to expertly restrain.  

You’re captured in moments.  You don’t even have time to reach for your sword before the weapon is pulled from your back.  A moment later, the blaster on your belt is gone too, along with your pants, boots, shirt, and cape.  Because in addition to the four silk-spinning legs wrapping you up, there are also four more legs armed with sharp pincers at the end of them, able to slice through your clothing like a hot knife through butter.  In less than a second you’re naked, and a second after that every limb has been completely plastered with silk, cutting off even the most basic of movements.  Then you’re spun around, so quickly you can’t even see what’s got you, other than a few flashes of red skin and black chiton.  Before your head stops spinning, you feel something force your lips open and glue a gob of sticky webbing into your mouth, gumming up your tongue and making anything other than a helpless mewling wail impossible to vocalize.  And once your voice is cut off, the gag is fixed in place around the back of your head, and you’re hoisted up into the air, suspended above your equally defeated wife.

In less than a minute, you’ve been transformed from capable explorer to utterly powerless damsel, as much a prisoner as Revissa.  You can’t move a muscle, can’t make a sound, can’t even twitch your tail.  You’re trapped, completely and utterly, and the culprit who so effortlessly defeated you is standing below you with a satisfied look on her face.

“I knew there was something wandering all over my forest,” she says, lazily tugging on a silk line to make the two of you vibrate.  “But if I’d known you were such cuties I’d have tracked you down much sooner.  Just what *were* you doing, poking around in so many places?”

You should have known better.  Spending so much time without making any progress, it was only a matter of time before something took notice.  That something is a gorgeous spider lady, and now the two of you are utterly helpless and completely at her mercy.  You strain fruitlessly against the impossibly tight webbing, finding not even an iota of leeway to squirm out of it.  There’s no escaping from this one.

Idly, the spider-woman digs through the equipment she liberated from your body.  She notices your comm device, and smashes it against a tree, making sure no one uses it to track you.  Then she finds the data collection device, and, not knowing what it is, sets it down on the ground then vaporizes it with your hand-held blaster.  So much for your mission.  But that’s the least of your worries right now.  

“Hmm…” she says lazily, looking up towards are bundled up prizes once she’s finished combing through your stuff.  “Now what to do with my new toys…”

You make a plaintive mewling sound into your gag, but it does nothing towards convincing her to let you go.  If anything, the absolute helplessness in your eyes only confirms the idea she has for your fate.

“I know!  You two love wandering around so much… so how would you like to tour the galaxy?  As product demonstrations.”

At the moment, it’s impossible to tell what she means by that.  But as your new life starts to unfold, you’re about to find out.

[[Go on tour-&gt;FA06C]]
]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="239" name="FA06C" tags="" position="1400,700" size="100,100">Over time, you come to know who your owner is, and what plans she has for Spectra I.  Her name is Tula, and she’s a Spider Princess - a half-breed offshoot of the aggressively territorial Spider Queen race.  The queens are powerful arachnid hybrids, bearing the upper torso of a beautiful woman and the lower body of a massive spider, and they love nothing more than to conquer isolated colonies or undefended planets and turn them into slave territories.  Prisoners are kept in check with cocoons made of their natural silken fibers, wrapped up tight and either put on display or relegated to sex toys in their harem halls.  But various complicated feats of chemistry, biology, and engineering are required to keep their cocooned captives fresh and enticing, forming a whole industry around the maintenance of permanently silk-bound prisoners.

Tula is hoping to disrupt the whole market by introducing a new product.  She’s tending to a fruit orchard here on the planet, fruits which, when consumed, confer the properties of ‘ghost matter’ to the silk produced by spider-kind.  In other words, instead of all that intricate and messy science, spider queens can instead eat a piece of fruit once a day and their webbing will be strong and sturdy, and will keep those wrapped up in it stuck in indefinite stasis.  No need to feed or care for them, no need to even worry about the frailties of old age - so long as they’re wrapped, the slaves won’t need any maintenance at all.  To sell her product, she’ll have to attend some technology expos, and she’ll need some ‘floor models’ to show off the wondrous power of ‘ghost silk’, as she calls it.  You and Revissa are going to be those models.

And so, she bundles you up, nice and tight, and packs you away in some shipping crates, to only be brought out when you’re being used to hawk her merchandise.  During sales events, you and Revissa are strung up in the middle of a show floor, where prospective buyers are encouraged to skitter up and examine you both to their heart’s content.  Grope you, finger you, pleasure you, poke and prod you with scientific instruments, confirm the reality that so long as you’re cocooned, you won’t ever need any kind of medical attention.  Suffice it to say, her product is a hit, sending her all over the galaxy on increasingly lucrative tours.

Over time, her business grows and grows, such that after a year or so, she’s gained enough notoriety that she no longer needs to prove herself by utilizing product displays.  And so you and Revissa spend longer and longer increments helplessly stuffed inside a shipping crate, as consistently helpless as the moment you were first caught.  As the years go by, your days on showroom floors dwindle to barely nothing, making you wonder if you’re eventually just going to be confined to the back of some musty storage closet forever.  But your fortunes finally turn on one of the rare days where you’re out on display.

[[Discover a new routine-&gt;FA06D]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="240" name="FA06D" tags="" position="1275,700" size="100,100">Spider Queen sales events are, naturally, mainly populated either by Spider Queens, or by their representatives, usually their slave race of Marsyhan foot soldiers.  So it’s no surprise that you don’t encounter any familiar faces during your times on display.  But one day, towards the end of a shift, one happens to show up.

“Huh?  Melfy?  Is that you?”

You’re currently wrapped up against a tall metal pole, arranged vertically, with Revissa wrapped on the other end behind you.  You make a muffled ‘mmph’ of recognition as a woman from your past skitters into view.

She’s a Spider Queen named Azkumo, and you used to date her, many years ago.  Unlike most of her kind she was actually quite gentle and loving, but that wasn’t exactly what you wanted in an arachnid girlfriend, so you broke up with her.  Last you’d heard, she’d gotten into the film business, trying to make it as a holo actress.

Her eyes drift over your cocooned form, lingering on your bare breasts which are poking out from the silken wrapping.  She gives them an idle squeeze as she flags down the sales representative.  It’s been ages since Tula herself ran the booth at a convention; now she’s a big-time CEO, and she delegates responsibility to other Spider Princesses in her employ.  The rep quickly skitters over, and immediately gets a star-struck look in her eye as she recognizes your ex.  Apparently in the time since you’ve been captured, her film career has actually managed to take off.

“How much for the model?” she asks, nodding in your direction.

“O-oh… I’m terribly sorry ma’am… they’re not exactly for sale.  The products are the ghost-silk fruits…”

“Yes, but I want to buy her,” she insists, gently stroking your tail.  “How much?”

There’s a panicked grunt from behind you as Revissa voices her displeasure at the thought of being separated from you.  Azkumo seems to pick up on it.

“Fine, for both of them,” she continues, without missing a beat.  When the sales rep remains flabbergasted, she waves a credit chip in front of her.  “Let’s say 10,000 apiece.  Deal?”

She doesn’t wait for a reply, simply tapping her chip against the rep’s transaction pad and letting the payment go through.  And then she hoists you down off the pole and cradles you lovingly in her arms.

“What was it you said, all those years ago?” she says, with a devilish gleam in her eye.  “I wasn’t aggressive enough?  Too docile and loving?”

Her finger slips itself past the webbing and between your thighs.

“Well… I’ve learned a lot since then… and I’ll be happy to be every bit the domineering mistress you wanted from me.”

Without another word to the rep, she slides you onto her back, then does the same for Revissa.  You and your wife can only exchange panicked glances, unsure if this development is good or bad for your prospects of freedom.  For her part, Azkumo doesn’t give you another word as she skitters back to the starship hangar and loads you both onto her personal space yacht.  Being a holo-star has its perks, after all.

Especially ones like Azkumo, who clearly has some elvaan blood somewhere in her heritage, as evidenced by her dark gray skin tone (pureblooded Queens are a bright red).  And so she remains a big-name holo star for a full century and a half before she finally retires, settling down in a palatial mansion on a small moon she owns herself.

You and Revissa remain cocooned the entire time, never given even an ounce of freedom.  But at least you’re treated better than you were before.  You live out your days wrapped up in one of Azkumo’s bedrooms, your sexual needs tended to by her serving staff, who make sure to stimulate you both to completion at least five times a day.  As for your mistress, she spends less than half her time at her home, though when she does she always makes sure to give you some attention.  You’re not alone in that regard.  It turns out she’s collected every single one of her exes (and their romantic partners, if they’d found one since breaking up with her), and each one gets a dedicated bedroom to spend their days in.  Becoming a star also toughened her up, opened up the possessiveness her species is known for, though at least she is still loving and affectionate to her slaves rather than cruel.

And that is what you are - a slave.  It’s a step up from being a floor model for a line of silk products, but it doesn&#39;t give you any more freedom or agency in your life.  As advertised, Tula’s ghost silk keeps you young, fresh, and healthy for as long as you remain wrapped in it, without even a single fiber ever getting severed or loosened.  Which means, as the years stretch on endlessly, you’ll never have to worry about anything other than when the next time your owner will come in to give you some loving.

And if she’d had her way, that’s what you’d have remained for the rest of your lives.  But thankfully, you finally get a reprieve after years of captivity.  The Star Scout candy you swallowed so long ago proves to still be functional, sending out a distress call to the surrounding areas of space.  A passing scout one day happens to pick up on it and land on the planet, and successfully manages to negotiate with Azkumo for your freedom.  Though only on the condition you and Revissa volunteer as ‘background cocoons’ in independent holo-films for at least two weeks out of every year.  

Finally free, you find yourselves in an entirely unfamiliar galaxy that’s changed immeasurably since you were first captured.  That’s a whole new story in and of itself, but, needless to say, you’ve both failed your original mission.

Technically, it could be considered trespassing to just stroll onto another person’s vessel like this, but aren’t you all kind of trespassing on this planet already?  Besides, the loading ramp is down, so it doesn’t look like they’re in high security mode or anything.

As you approach the ship, you can’t help but be appreciative of its design.  Unlike your Lucky Break, which has just an inelegant, boxy appearance, the Knottie craft is sleek and stylish, even for a cargo ship.  Knottie vessels are known for their signature squid-like shape, with the main ‘head’ at the front where the cargo and crew sit, and the long, mobile ‘tendrils’ at the back.  Though Knottie vessels are not the fastest or the strongest in the galaxy, they are absolutely the most maneuverable, thanks in no small part to the thruster arrays positioned all along the ‘tendrils’, each like the sucker on an octopus&#39;s arm.  It makes sense that this would be their priority, since the signature weapon on Knottie starships are their ‘energy nets’.  Basically, they fight by releasing long lines of electro-plasmic discharge in tight rings around enemy ships, literally tying them up with highly reactive material that fries propulsion, weapons, and guidance systems.  Once a ship is disabled, they love to board the enemy vessel and tie up its crew the same way they did the ship.

Well, let’s just hope that if you do get tied up here that it’s with some nice, soft ropes and not electro-plasma.

Once you finish musing on the marvels of Knottie engineering, you begin to walk up the loading ramp.  But as you do, you see several hovering security drones lying in wait just off to the side.  They are small, flat devices, about the size of a fist, but you know that doesn’t mean they can’t swiftly incapacitate you if they set their programming to it.  Which means that they likely aren’t going to be welcoming to visitors.]

The pre-fab buildings were clearly built for efficiency rather than aesthetics, made out of interchangeable parts that look as if they snap together like children’s building blocks.  Unlike the spaceship, which clearly has a Knottie design, the buildings have no distinctive style markings to them and could just have easily housed orcs, kemomi, or elvaans (okay, maybe not elvaans.  Most wouldn’t be caught dead living somewhere so drab).  Peering through a window, you find a barracks-like bedroom that could probably house four women at a time, though currently there’s no one visible living inside of it.

It honestly does look like the whole place is deserted.  If you wanted, you could spend the time to search each building individually - it doesn’t look like the doors are locked at all.

Presumably, those amber chunks scattered around it are related to the sticky resin you saw coming from the tree near the river.

You have to stifle a gasp when you notice it.  Though the hardened chunks of sap are mostly opaque, when you get close enough you can see past the surface to what lies inside.  Each piece of resin holds a woman trapped inside of it, all of them bearing the distinctive head tendrils of the Knottie species.  The women are nude, and have expressions on their faces ranging from surprised, to relaxed, to aroused.  None of them are moving, which isn’t surprising, though at least they don’t appear to be in any immediate danger. (if: $rosamber is true)[However, among them is Ros’eela, you can’t help but notice.

(if: $ros is true)[
“These… are my co-workers,” Ros’eela says, walking up in front of the amber hunk and looking inside.  “This one is Nabri.  And that’s In’Deliab.  Crap, we were training together just the other day!”

You put a hand on her shoulder.  “I’m sure there’s some way to get them out of there,” you say quietly, glancing towards your wife for her input.
]
“They’re alive,” Revissa confirms, laying her hand on the smooth surface of one of the amber stones.  “This is made of the same Ghost Matter as the rest of the stuff on this planet, so they’ll be safe and healthy for as long as they’re in there.”

That’s a relief.  Though it doesn’t answer the question of how they got trapped in the first place.  Was it some kind of industrial accident?  Or… is there something more sinister at play here…

“Can they be freed?” you ask, casting a suspicious eye around the area for any signs of danger.

Revissa shakes her head.  “It’s… really strong stuff, I am pretty sure.  Conventional weapons would be useless against it.  But maybe the Squira priestesses of Del Thora would be able to do something.  They make use of a Sacred Sap in their rituals that has similar properties.”

On the one hand, they’re not stuck forever.  On the other, it means that there’s probably no tools you have in your arsenal here that can rescue anyone caught in the stuff.  So you definitely need to be diligent about finding what did this.

“Any clues about how this happened to them?” you ask.  “If there were any storage jugs around or something I would maybe guess there was some kind of industrial accident, but there’s nothing here… other than this giant flower…”

Too late do you realize the source of the threat, before it already starts to reveal itself.  You hear the rustle of leaves, smell the sweet scent of potent pollen, and see the massive leaves unfurl to reveal the culprit of the Knotties’ entrapment.

Maybe by looking it over, you’ll get a better idea about how the Knotties are running their operation.  You and Revissa move through the camp towards the work site, trying to remain silent, even though there doesn’t seem to be any activity or movement. 

As you get closer, the nature of the equipment becomes more apparent.  There’s some kind of saw apparatus that looks to be purposed for cutting down trees and shaping them into uniformly sized logs.  Another device is processing and purifying the tree sap you had seen earlier, pushing it through large vats that filter out any excess material from the liquid.  Yet another machine makes your skin crawl, since it features a conveyor that seems purposed for sending animal carcasses into a chamber that cleans and tans the material into usable leather.

With each machine you examine, Revissa grows more and more upset, until she comes to the last one in the line and points at it accusingly.  

“I don’t even know what this one does, but whatever it is, I’m sure it’s disrespectful!” she yells.  “Think of all those poor animals!”

You do your best to keep your mouth shut.  After all, as a kemomi, meat is an important part of your diet, and you never think too hard about where the stuff you buy comes from.  Sure, most of it is probably lab-grown, but you’ve been known to splurge every once in a while after a nice payday on a big, juicy, naturally-made steak.

Either way, it looks like Revissa is about to start getting violent with this equipment.  If you don’t lead her away now, she’s probably going to cause some property damage.

And so you stand aside as she waves her staff around and channels her nature magic into a transformation with incredible destructive force!  Before your eyes, you see her body shift, growing to a massive size as powerful scales ripple along her skin and a fearsome roar echoes from her throat.  She’s pulled out the big guns this time, changing herself into a mighty T-Rex!  

As a terrible thunder lizard, she is almost twelve feet tall, all sense of humanoid attractiveness abandoned in exchange for the capacity to wreak massive property damage.  Unlike some of her other transformations, this one comes with some significant drawbacks.  Namely, that she does not retain her intelligence when she is a dino, nor is it easy for her to keep hold on the structure of the spell.  Despite her size, a single strong hit can break her concentration and cause her to turn back into a lovely deer - though luckily for her, there doesn’t appear to be anything nearby that can cause her any damage.

And so, she gets to work.  If you had popcorn, you would start munching on it.  Standing a good deal away from the carnage, you watch as she stomps and chomps, slices and dices, grinding all the machines to dust over the course of about ten minutes.  Only once everything is reduced to scrap and slag does she finally return to her adorable normal self, coming out of the transformation both exhausted yet exhilarated.

“Take that!” she yells, kicking a piece of sparking machinery off into the forest.  On its way, however, it clunks loudly against one final device that hitherto had escaped her wrath.

“Looks like you missed one,” you say, looking the equipment over.  

Unlike the other things, the purpose of this last gizmo is not immediately evident.  All it looks like is a small circular platform, maybe three feet wide, with two long metal poles sticking up from the sides.

She smirks as she sizes it up.

“Seems pretty flimsy,” she concludes.  “What do you say?  Wanna put those muscles to use and help me smash it with our own two hands?”

How could you say no to a smile like that?  And so you join her in walking up onto the platform.  You’re about to take hold of one of the metal poles to try prying it off when a loud robotic voice suddenly echoes from the machine’s base.

“PRESSURE PLATE ACTIVATED,” it drones.  “ANALYZING MATERIAL.  DESIGNATION - HUMANOID.  TWO SUBJECTS.  BEGINNING PACKAGING PROCESS.”

Wait… packaging?  Does that mean this device is used to bundle up the harvested materials and place them into containers for shipping.  Oh crap, that means–

“ACTIVATING PARALYSIS CHARGE,” the machine announces, before the base you are both standing on begins to vibrate with electricity.  

You both only have just enough time to realize the grave error you have made before it becomes entirely too late to avert it.  A powerful surge of energy rushes through both of your bodies, completely cutting off any motor functions.  The result is the two of you trapped in place, quivering from electric shock, unable to move, speak, or escape what is about to come.

“BEGINNING PACKAGING PROCESS.  REMOVING EXCESS OBSTRUCTIONS.”

A laser shines from the tip of the two poles, moving in an arc over your helpless figures.  And wherever it touches, clothing vaporizes, destroying all your weapons and gear.  You’re both left naked and exposed on the platform as it enters the next phase of your folly.

“ADJUSTING POSITIONING FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE.”

The platform vibrates again, delivering a surge of energy that jump-starts your muscles, forcing the two of you to take jerky steps closer to one another.  You press against each other tightly, arms shakily shifting so that you are intimately holding hands.

“LOADING ORGANIC CONTAINMENT TAPE.  BEGIN SPOOLING.”

There is a whir from beneath you as the platform starts to rotate, at the same time that several rolls of black duct tape are loaded onto the long poles.  The adhesive ends are stuck onto your skin, causing the tape to wind around you over and over, moving up and down to bind you up like a couple of love-struck mummies.

You can’t even make a sound of protest as the machine does its work, a single coil looping around your heads to force your lips together.  Tighter and tighter it presses, squishing your breasts into each other, covering up your face, your tail, your legs, your feet, concealing every inch of your naked skin as it finishes up the first layer and gets started on the second. 

At this point you’re entirely cut off from the outside world, shrouded in complete darkness, unable to even effectively hear since your floppy ears have been pressed down against the top of your head.  Mostly you just feel the vibrations as a third, then a fourth layer of tape is wound up around you, followed after that by some kind of spray that seems to be forming a lacquer-like seal over your impromptu prison.  Knotties are known for being fastidious when it comes to bondage, always going the extra mile to ensure the utter impossibility of escape of those subjected to their cultural forte, and it would seem their technology shares that attention to detail.  When the machine stops spinning the two of you are so firmly bound up that the very idea of getting out of it is laughable.  Instead, you just get released from the device’s grip and tip over helplessly, dropping into a waiting storage crate that is perfectly sized to fit your expertly packaged bodies.

And besides, you still don’t know what happened to the workers here.

For a moment, you think that things are settled now.  But then Revissa just can’t help herself but to aim a snarky quick Ros’eela’s way.

“Maybe to your people, the only spirituality is found in bondage,” she grumbles.  “But for me, I find meaning in nature itself.”

That, unfortunately, gets the two of them going into a heated debate about the virtues of each of their cultures, an argument that, after the first ten minutes, you realize isn’t going to end anytime soon.  And so, with a sigh, you flop down against the side of one of the machines and keep yourself out of it, taking a moment to appreciate the sights and sounds of the forest around you.  After all, you owe it to Revissa to take in that thing which she wants to protect.

It is, admittedly, very beautiful.  The color of the trees, the sound of scurrying animals, the feel of the grass against your feet, and the sweet, cloying smell of pollen wafting through the air.

Actually… that last one really is quite engrossing.  A thick, invigorating scent, one that seems to linger in your nostrils when you breathe it in, that flows through your body and fills you with a strange sense of warmth.  No… more than warmth.  It’s more like… a desire.  An imperative.  Yes, that’s what it is.    It grips you with a surprising amount of power, forces you into a dreamy daze of contentment and arousal.

And it seems the others felt it too.  Revissa and Ros’eela have stopped arguing and started kissing, falling on top of each other and rolling in the grass as they furiously make out.  Full of desire, you can’t help but throw yourself into the fray as well, knocking Ros’eela aside to monopolize Revissa for yourself.  The pink Knottie seems upset at first, but eventually allows herself to relax and wander off in a daze, heading towards the source of that alluring smell.

You and Revissa spend a good five minutes necking before you, too, find yourselves drawn in the same direction, walking in a dreamy stupor towards the intoxicating aroma.

Namely, that she does not retain her intelligence when she is a dino, nor is it easy for her to keep hold on the structure of the spell.  Despite her size, a single strong hit can break her concentration and cause her to turn back into a lovely deer - and unluckily for her, Ros’eela seems none to keen about standing by while she wrecks her people’s equipment.

“Woah… hey, calm down there!” she yells, making what you would have thought to have been a rather foolish gambit, running right in front of the rampaging dino as she starts chomping at one of the machines.  

But it seems you underestimated the resourceful Knottie, because she manages to divert Revissa’s destructive tantrum with the use of a sturdy piece of wire, using her acrobatic skills honed as a slave dancer to leap and tumble around her legs without getting smushed.  As she goes she wraps the wire around Revissa’s monstrous limbs, pulling taut in such a way to send her tumbling to the ground.  When she impacts she loses her concentration on her spell, re-forming into her normal lovely self, albeit now she’s on her back and bundled up in an awkward hog-tie.

Honestly… you’re more impressed than upset.  You’ve never seen anyone incapacitate Revissa so quickly once she’d gone into dino mode.  But you’re not about to let the pink lady get the last word in over your wife, so you helpfully draw your sword and sever the ropes keeping her bound.

“Why’d you stop me!” Revissa snarls.  You halfway think she’s going to cast the same spell again to resume her rampage.

“Are you forgetting that I work here!” Ros’eela yells back.  “If I just stood by and watched I’d get chewed out by my boss… err… not that she seems to be around here right now.”

Sure enough, the camp remains totally empty.  

“It… really is weird,” the Knottie continues.  “She was always standing around here, overseeing the machinery and updating inventory logs on her data pad.  But now she’s… woah hey, wait.”

She notices something in the grass and picks it up.  

“This… *is* her data pad,” she muses.  “That lady was practically glued to this thing.  Something crazy must have happened if she just dropped it like that.”

And so the mystery deepens.  But it doesn’t seem like you’ll find any more clues in this area, so it’s best to keep looking elsewhere.  Revissa seems to have calmed down a bit now… though as you double back you see her turn around and eye that equipment with a ferocious gleam in her eye…

The most you can do is vibrate helplessly as your mummified forms are fitted into the storage crate, squirming pointlessly as some metal clamps shut down around your figure to prevent any future shifting of position.  This leaves you with nothing to do but wonder how the hell you could possibly get out of this.

Though, now that you think about it, doesn’t the tape smell a bit like the tree resin you found on your way over here?  Is the adhesive locally sourced?  That would mean the tape has the properties of the planet’s unique Ghost Matter - namely, that you could be kept wrapped up indefinitely without the need of food, water, or other health services.  You wouldn’t even age a day!

“HEALTH SCAN COMPLETE.  SUBJECTS ONE AND TWO, GHOST MATTER PROTOCOLS CONFIRMED.  NO FURTHER INTERACTION NECESSARY.   INFORMING COMMAND OF PACKAGING STATUS…

Well, that confirms what you had just figured out all on your own.  And at least someone is being informed of what’s happened here.  Hopefully the Knotties won’t be too upset with Revissa destroying all their equipment… 

“....ORDERS RECEIVED.  COMMAND DECISION: INITIATE MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT PROTOCOLS.   LOCKING CONTAINMENT UNIT.  LOCK UNLEASH METHODS: NONE.  CONTAINMENT DURATION: PERMANENT.  NEXT OBJECTIVE: RELOCATE CONTAINMENT UNIT TO PLACE IT WILL NEVER BE FOUND.

Wait… what?  A little bit of property damage and they’re going to lock you away… forever?  And hide you someplace no one will ever find you?  You’d love to voice your opinion on that matter to the packaging machine, but you’re not capable of making any sounds at all.  So all the two of you can do is wriggle and moan uselessly as some hovering drones appear in the air and float down, inserting a data transfer wire into your storage container to inform it what needs to be done next.  The lid snaps shut, and you hear a series of powerful locks snap into place.  The two of you are thus plunged into absolute darkness, with no way to communicate other than plaintive grunts and groans.  Then you feel the box rumble and shake, presumably being lifted off the ground by those same droids, as it gets carried through the air to places unknown.

It’s only when you feel yourself being dropped, then a sense of bobbing up and down for a moment before you feel downwards descent that you figure it out.  All of that would be consistent with… water?  Your heart sinks just like your body as you realize the drones have decided to secure your captivity by dropping your prison into the deep ocean.  You feel yourself sinking for what feels like an hour before the box finally comes to a halt, resting at a slightly skewed angle from what must be the uneven ground at the very bottom of the sea.

This is absurd.  Why would the drones be programmed to dispose of you in this way?  You at least deserve a trial, or a chance to make your case in front of someone!  But you get no more input, no response to your helpless moans of protest.  There’s nothing the two of you can do but settle into your new, unending life of captivity.  You’re not sure if you should be thankful or upset that the cargo container you’ve been sealed in is so incredibly sturdy.  It seems totally resilient to the intense pressures of the deep ocean, not springing any leaks or bending or buckling in the slightest.  Under normal circumstances, if it ruptured while you were this deep you’d either drown or be crushed by the water pressure - probably both.  But considering the properties of ghost matter, maybe your life would be preserved until you naturally floated back up to the surface.

But that is a moot point, since the case remains firm.  With bindings made of ghost matter, you’ll never need food or water, never age a day.  Meaning that the two of you can persist here in utter helplessness for the rest of your long, long lives.  

No one ever comes to save you - how could they?  How could they possibly locate you when you’ve been dumped to the bottom of the ocean.  So all that’s left is to live out the ages in total darkness, with nothing but the occasional thump of a passing fish against your container as entertainment.

Thankfully, you swallowed that Star Scout homing beacon at the start of your adventure.  Without it, your allies would never have been able to find you.  As it stands, it still takes them three weeks of searching, moving in wider and wider arcs around the planet, before they finally get a strong enough signal to lock onto your location.  And then it takes another month of negotiations and requisitions to acquire the proper equipment to dig you up from the bottom of the sea.  Of course, the whole time you’re trapped, you have no idea there’s any rescue coming, so after the first few days you had settled into the prospect of this being the end for you.

Lucky for you it isn’t - though sadly your mission has ended in a resounding failure.  The data collection device is destroyed, and Vhaja had to pull every string she had to get someone to come to restricted space to save you - greatly damaging her career in the process.

“Hello…” you say happily.

“We’re sorry… for the intrusion…” Revissa adds weakly, her eyes as blank and submissive as yours.  “We were… investigating why… there were people harvesting the resources in this forest…”

The two of you have completely fallen under the spell of this beautiful plant woman.  She has rich green skin, short, fluffy hair the texture of leaves, and curvaceous body that extends down to the thighs before it vanishes into the center of the petals of the giant flower.  The interior of her flower is filled with more of that amber liquid, sloshing around whenever she moves, creating the powerful, honey-sweet scent that so effectively rendered you and your wife into compliant slaves.

“Hrmm…” the plant woman says with a frown.  “It’s true… they didn’t belong here.  But it’s okay!  Now they do!  They’re part of the forest now, and they’ll stay that way forever!”

You and Revissa nod blankly, as if to agree that were a fitting punishment for their crimes.  Though with every syllable that falls from her lips, you both find yourselves falling deeper and deeper into your erotic haze.  It’s impossible to think of anything other than acting on those impulses.  Thankfully, the plant woman seems to be able to read the looks of desire on your faces, and is kind enough to start nudging you in the direction you need to go in

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

Slowly, you open your lips to tell her, but strangely, you find that you can’t remember it.  You can’t remember anything at all.  Why you’re here, where you came from - none of it.  And so you just stare blankly, an apologetic look on your face, sorry for letting her down.  But then she smiles, and its as if everything in the world is right again.

“Oh… that’s okay.  Names aren’t that important anyway.  Besides, I can see how much you two are in love with each other.  And it would be a real shame to keep you apart.  So, why don’t you get yourselves out of those clothes, and we can find a place for you here as well?”

In the state that you are, nothing would make you happier.

Normally, your first instinct would be to prepare for battle, reach for your sword or blaster pistol, maybe snarl and bare your teeth in challenge.  But you do none of those things.  Instead, you just turn around, a placid smile on your face as your nostrils fill with a saccharine scent that dulls your senses and lulls you into a placid, compliant daze.  And you look up into a pair of beautiful, nurturing eyes.

“Hello…” you say happily.

“We’re sorry… for their intrusion…” Revissa adds weakly, her eyes as blank and submissive as yours.  “We were… investigating why… there were people harvesting the resources in this forest…”

The two of you have completely fallen under the spell of this beautiful plant woman.  She has rich green skin, short, fluffy hair the texture of leaves, and a curvaceous body that extends down to the thighs before it vanishes into the center of the petals of the giant flower.  The interior of her flower is filled with more of that amber liquid, sloshing around whenever she moves, creating the powerful, honey-sweet scent that so effectively rendered you and your wife into compliant slaves.

“Hrmm…” the plant woman says with a frown.  “It’s true… they didn’t belong here.  But it’s okay!  Now they do!  They’re part of the forest now, and they’ll stay that way forever!”

You and Revissa nod blankly, as if to agree that were a fitting punishment for their crimes.  With every syllable that falls from her lips, you both fall deeper and deeper under her control, any thoughts of resistance or escape quickly banished from your minds.

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

Slowly, you open your lips to tell her, but strangely, you can’t remember.  You can’t remember anything at all.  Why you’re here, where you came from - none of it.  And so you just stare blankly, an apologetic look on your face, sorry for letting her down.  But then she smiles, and its as if everything in the world is right again.

“Oh… that’s okay.  Names aren’t that important anyway.  Now why don’t we get you two out of those clothes, and then we can find a place for you to fit into this forest as well?”

It fills you with an indescribable joy, to know that Petal would want to allow you to remain here in the forest with her.  Even after you’ve been so rude, forgetting your name like that.  And so you readily comply, lamely fumbling with boots and belts and shirts and pants, dropping weapons and equipment that you no longer even know the purpose of.  When you’ve finally got everything off, Petal gives you a nod of appreciation that makes your heart swell with pride, and then makes a motion for you to hold still.  Of course, you comply.

You and Revissa stand there as long, leafy tendrils extend from the bottom of her flower, wrapping around you and tightly restraining your limbs.  They feel taut and secure, too strong for you to break out of - though that’s a moot point, since you’d never want to run away from your new favorite person in the world.  Looking between the two of you, she decides to start with your wife, hoisting her up into the air and then dunking her upside down into the center of the pool of sap inside her flower, making sure to cover every inch of her body.  When she’s pulled out, her face is in a placid state of relaxment, all ounce of tension or worry banished from her frame.  She draws Revissa in for a long, lusty kiss, then suspends her in the air, allowing more and more of her nectar to drip down her vines to continue coating her.

“And now it’s your turn,” she says brightly, the very sound of her voice filling you with an indescribable warmth.  

The vines holding you yank you upwards, getting no resistance from you as you’re brought in close.

“And down you go!”

As you’re dunked into her nectar, you feel the sweet amber liquid fill your throat, feel it drip down to your stomach then flow through the rest of your body to circulate the warmth and calmness it brings.  It makes you feel nothing but joy.  You sigh in delight as your worries, your fears, your life before this moment all melt away, leaving you as nothing but a vessel for pleasure and contentment as she draws you in for your kiss.]

Her lips are soft yet firm, warm and inviting, infinitely calming.  You surrender every aspect of your being to that kiss, give her all of what you are and ever will be.  She seems to enjoy that.  As she draws back from the kiss, she tenderly caresses your cheek, then casts her eyes around the clearing.

“Now then… where to put this one…”

There’s a flat tree stump a short distance from her flower, probably cut down by harvesting tools employed by the Knottie interlopers.  Keeping your wrists restrained above your head, she flips you right side up and sets you down on the stump, letting the heavenly nectar flow over your unresisting body.

Across from you, you hear a thump, and are just barely cognizant enough to turn your attention towards the sound.  You see that Revissa has finished ‘marinating’, the sap having hardened into a thick hunk of amber around her unprotesting body.  She looks so utterly at peace in her new home, eyes closed, the slightest of smiles apparent on her pursed lips.

Like the Knotties around her, she’s now become a part of the forest, the amber encasing her somehow harnessing her life energy to facilitate growth and nourishment in the trees around her.  You’re not quite sure how you even know that, but it seems obvious to you that this is the case.  And now that you know it, you are deeply eager to join her in service to the forest.

A torrent of sap flows over your body, at first forming a glistening, lacquer-like coating over your skin, but eventually congealing as more and more is provided.  Soon it has fully hardened, forming an oblong, opaque shell for you to stand in, a perfectly snug cocoon of resin that hugs every inch of your body from finger to toe.  You’ve never felt more at peace, more attuned to the world around you, your bright eyes and eager smile a reminder of the happiness that now remains frozen on your inanimate face.]

“There we go!  I think it’s perfect!” Petal says cheerily, pulling her tendrils away from the new adornment to her happy little grotto.  “Everyone is right where they need to be!  And that’s where they’ll stay.”

And so, after a quiet moment of appreciation surveying the new additions to her collection, she stretches her arms, yawns lazily, then recedes into her flower, folding the petals over her torso and disappearing from view.

The days pass by in a blur, soon becoming years, decades, and centuries, the forest treating you and the others like nothing more than inert rocks.  You don’t mind one bit.  You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew - maybe they got caught by something else on the planet, or maybe they searched for you but could never find you.  It hardly seems to matter.  After all, you’ve got everything you want right here.  

No pain, no worries, no stress, no conflict, just warm sunlight and fresh pollen.  The lovely Petal who put you here is long gone, spreading her roots to other parts of the forest that need nutrients like you to keep it flourishing.  She leaves you and the others behind, so that you can keep protecting your new home, maintain order and balance and harmony, from now until the end of your days.

You wouldn’t have it any other way.

It is only many months later when you finally awaken from your torpor.  As it turns out, the rest of your crew were able to track you down thanks to your Star Scout homing beacon, extracted your amber shells and kept you in storage on your starship until a solution could be found.  That answer, like Revissa expected, resided on Del Thora, where the Squira priestesses were able to use techniques they had mastered with their native sacred sap to thaw you both out.

After you recover, you’ll be thankful for the rescue.  But for now all you have to look forward to are weeks of convalescence, both physical and mental, as you slowly regain the ability to treat yourself as a discrete entity and not just another part of the forest.  Someday, you’ll travel the galaxy again, but even if you do, you’ll never get another chance to complete this particular mission.

Maybe next time, you’ll be more careful about smelling the roses.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="261" name="FC02AA" tags="" position="3350,825" size="100,100">You turn to Revissa and give her a nudge with your arm.

“Hey, don’t you have some magic that works like active camouflage?”

She nods.  “Yes, it was very helpful during my days in the resistance.”

Well, she’s not exactly fighting for the freedom of her homeworld right now, but she’s still trying to save a forest.  So it’s kind of the same thing.  With a wave of her staff, she shrouds the two of you in a magical aura that causes you both to take on the chameleon-like property of blending in with anything you press your body up against.  Yeah, this should work!

Together, you creep up the loading ramp and then press against the back wall of the cargo bay, letting the magic change your skin to the same metallic color of the wall behind you.  So far, so good.  And then you begin to shimmy along the edge of the bay, trying not to upset the small squadron of drones keeping watch.

Unfortunately…

“HEAT SOURCE DETECTED” one of the tiny drones announces in a loud robotic voice.  And then a half-dozen of them break off and zoom right towards you!

Well, crap.  It figures they would have ways of detecting enemies rather than just visual scanners.  You and Revissa both reach for your weapons, but before you get that chance, the drones are upon you.  A bright red light emits from their center, sending a laser pulse up and down your bodies.

“DISINTEGRATION BEAMS ACTIVATED!” they helpfully announce, just as every scrap of clothing is instantly eradicated from your bodies.  That includes your sword and Revissa’s staff, making both of you sitting ducks as they continue to operate according to their programming.

“CAPTURE PROTOCOLS INITIATED” they say next, whizzing around you as they begin to dispense some sort of sticky spools of tape from their bodies.  The material proves to be quite adhesive and frustratingly sturdy, wrapping around your arms, legs, and lips in no time flat.

“Hello!” you yell.  “Is there anybody on the ship that is available to talk?”

As expected, the security drones whizz out and begin to circle around you, flashing red lights on their surface indicating they have detected a potential threat.  But thankfully, they do not immediately attack.

“STATE PURPOSE OF VISIT” one announces with a prerecorded message, the robotic voice much louder than one might suspect from such a small device.

You glance at Revissa, and then shrug.  “We’re like to discuss your operations here in this forest, and, uh, politely suggest you reconsider your tactics so that you can, uh, be working in better harmony with the local ecosystem?”

There is a long pause.  

“PURPOSE IRRELEVANT”, the drone eventually announces.  “DEPART AT ONCE.”

Well, that settles that.  Maybe if you had done some recon at the main Knottie camp at the ruins, you’d have an idea of something you could say that would convince them to let you in.  But as it stands you’ve got nothing.

Up until now, you had been able to ignore it, but staying so stationary here, with nothing else to do, that scent permeates your being, clouds your mind.  And eventually, you find yourselves unable to do anything else but turn around and head towards its source, leaving the Knottie ship behind.

Three, two, one… go!

And then you leap out together and rush to the top of the loading ramp.  You have your sword drawn, and swing it in a wide arc to slice one of the security drones apart in a single sweep, while Revissa conjures a torrent of razor-sharp leaves to shred up another.  Yes, it’s working!  No trouble at all.

“INTRUDERS DETECTED,” one of the tiny drones announces in a loud robotic voice.  And then a half-dozen more of them suddenly fly out from a dark corner of the cargo bay, reinforcing the numbers of the ones you had already destroyed.

There’s… a *lot* of them.  They fall into formation to surround you, and a bright red light emits from their center, sending a laser pulse up and down your bodies.

You and Revissa were both quickly and easily defeated by the security drones, stripped and bound up in no time flat.  All you can do is squirm against the powerful grip of the adhesive tape, finding it impossible to sunder with brute strength alone.  If only you had something sharp to cut it with!

You recall the runic dagger Vhaja entrusted you with.  That would do the trick!  But all your gear was evaporated… or was it?  Glancing to the side, you find that out of pure luck, your pack where you keep all your important adventuring supplies survived disintegration, probably because the strap holding it was vaporized before the main pouch, causing it to fall away from your body.  That’s good, since the data collection device needed for the mission is in there.  Along with the knife!  

Slowly, you start to wiggle along the ground towards your bag, wondering why the drones are letting you make it this far.  Though to your surprise, when you glance upwards, you see that they appear to have gone inert.  Did something switch them off?  You can’t be sure, but it’s a fortunate stroke of luck that you won’t waste.  Moving like a wriggling worm, you reach the bag and manage to get it open with your chin, finding the knife inside and dropping it down onto the floor.

“Hrmmphhfggh?” you mutter into the tape gag over your lips, glancing at Revissa.

“Hey can you help me with this?” helpfully translates the gag-talk device.

With a nod, your wife squirms over as well, and together you manage to use your bodies to manipulate the knife’s blade towards the silvery tape and slice your wrists free from the bonds.  The rest is simple, and soon you’ve managed to escape, though your clothing is gone.  Good thing you have those matter synthesizer capsules Jyumon gave you in your bag as well.

Revissa is no better off than you.  A slightly duller color of tape was used to wrap her up, but it’s just as effective in rendering her helpless.  Like you, she’s mummified from the feet up to the lips, with only a little window for chest and tail to poke out of.  That is, of course, standard bondage protocol, since binding up the breasts could restrict air flow and cause harm to the target.  The whole point of tying someone up is to trap them, not hurt them.  And well… the two of you are quite thoroughly, completely, trapped.

Though, now that you think about it, doesn’t the tape smell a bit like the tree resin you found on your way over here?  Is the adhesive locally sourced?  That would mean the tape has the properties of the planet’s unique Ghost Matter - namely, that you could be kept wrapped up indefinitely without the need of food, water, or other health services.  You wouldn’t even age a day!

“HEALTH SCAN COMPLETE.  TARGETS ONE AND TWO, GHOST MATTER PROTOCOLS CONFIRMED.  NO FURTHER INTERACTION NECESSARY.  TRANSFERRING TARGETS TO LONG-TERM STORAGE UNITS.”

Well, that confirms what you had just figured out all on your own.  But wait… what’s this about long term storage?

With surprising power for such little droids, the robots spool out one last length of tape to stick to your bodies, and then use that to hoist you both up and carry you off to a remote corner of the cargo hold.  You and Revissa struggle and squirm with all your might, of course, but you make no progress at all of even loosening their hold on you.  It’s abundantly clear that both of you are well and truly helpless.  

The long-term storage unit proves to be a long, rectangular shipping crate - one with just enough room to fit two helplessly mummified captives.  Once you are in place over the box, the droids line the two of you up, pressing you in against each other so your breasts squish together nicely.  And then they apply one more layer of tape to bind you up against one another, even going so far as to wind a single loop around the back of your heads so your gagged lips touch in an ineffective kiss.  And once that is done, you’re slotted into the box, where some heavy metal clamps snap around your bodies to prevent you from even doing so much as wiggling.

“TARGET STATUS: SECURE.  INFORMING COMMAND OF CAPTURE STATUS…

Wait… what?  One little communication error and they’re going to lock you away… forever?  And hide you someplace no one will ever find you?  You’d love to voice your opinion on that matter to the droids, but you’re not capable of making any sounds at all.  So all the two of you can do is wriggle and moan uselessly as the lid of the storage container snaps shut, and you hear a series of powerful locks snap into place.  The two of you are thus plunged into absolute darkness, with no way to communicate other than plaintive grunts and groans.  Then you feel the box rumble and shake, and get lifted up off the ground, carried through the air to places unknown.

Various bits of bondage gear are strewn about on the floor, in handbags, or tucked into storage drawers - ropes, gags, cuffs, even a few stimulator devices.  All pretty standard fare, given the species camping here.  You do find a few personal comm devices, but sadly all of them are password protected - or at least you think they are.

(if: $ros is true)[“Here, let me unlock that,” Ros’eela offers.  “Believe it or not, I was actually hired for this mission to be tech support, so I have admin privileges.”

You don’t question why a server admin was allowed to spend a month in bondage training instead of doing her job.  It seems that is just how Knotties operate.  Once she gets the comm devices open, she discovers that the only thing of note they contain are some holographic recordings of some bondage sessions between the workers.  Fast forwarding through the videos, you’re treated to an intense back-and-forth between two women trying to one-up each other with the severity of their restraints, taking turns tying and escaping from each other.  But when one finally is bound in a way she can’t get out of, her partner solemnly loads her up into a shipping crate and has some drones carry her away.

Ros’eela seems surprised by this.  “I think… we just witnessed a Komad’chee,” she says carefully.  “It’s a kind of ritualistic combat, where the loser… well, accepts that she’ll be tied up… permanently.  Extreme stuff… normally only practiced by certain fundamentalist sects.  The Vida’chee is the more common form of the contest that’s just done for fun, but… I don’t think that’s what that was…”

This doesn’t seem particularly relevant to the task at hand, but potentially good to know for future interactions with the Knotties.  Are there potentially some hyper-fundamental bondage enthusiasts among their ranks?  That might put Krysta and Lumina in danger if their negotiations go south.  Something to keep in mind for later.  For the time being, however, there doesn’t seem to be anything more worth investigating in this building.

Freezium, of course, is a metal alloy that has the curious property of turning into a gas at low temperatures.  It has many uses, but the most iconic one is to spray down women to quickly encase them in the metal as it hardens at room temperature, bonding with their bodies and forming a solid structure in the shape of the frame built around them, which is usually a long, rectangular slab.  Though common in use throughout the galaxy, the Knottie people have always been known to have a strange affinity for it, despite their predilection towards bondage.

Investigating the slab, you find the containment frame is password-protected, so you won’t be able to just input a thawing sequence to free the woman inside.  If you had to guess, she was either a trophy owned by one of the workers in the outpost, or maybe she *is* one of the workers, and had this done to her as some kind of punishment.  Either way, in the adjoining room of the building you find a small freezium chamber as well that seems to be in working order.  It’s too bulky to drag around with you, but it’s good to know it’s here if you find yourself in need of frosting anyone over.

Curious, you pick up the device and look it over, trying to get it to speak again, but nothing you do seems to prompt any response.  Revissa, however, happens upon a solution.  As you puzzle with its controls, she sneaks behind you, then suddenly jams a ball-gag she found in a box between your lips.

“Hrggmmpg hrrmm?” you yell in surprise.

Revissa nods in approval.  “It’s a gag-talk translator,” she explains.

You enjoy a kinky bondage session as much as the next gal, but the Knotties take it to the next level with the amount of technology and culture dedicated to the pursuit of restraint.

Revissa finds a report on a nearby inventory console.  “It says here… the items are defective because they… *don’t* disintegrate the subject’s clothing before tying them up,” she says with a slight chuckle.

After all, freezium slabs always come with a built-in thawing mechanism.  And so, you drag Ros’eela’s crate over towards the freezing device, taking a moment to familiarize yourself with the controls.

The device takes the form of a six-foot tall cylindrical chamber, equipped with canisters of sublimated metal gas to do the freezing, and colonies of nanomachines to assemble the display frame used to contain the subject.  A hatch swivels open in the front, revealing the cramped interior in which a rectangular structure reminiscent of a doorway rests in the middle.  Restraints and shackles line the sides, a contrivance meant to ensure the positioning of an unwilling volunteer for the freezing process.  Considering how wiggly the latex-encased knottie is, you figure you’ll probably need to use them.

Though you’re by no means a tech wiz, you’re still better at this sort of stuff than Revissa, so you pilot the controls while your wife sets about prying open the crate and getting Ros’eela into position.  When the case creaks open, you find the pink-skinned girl just as utterly helpless as before, writhing powerlessly beneath the grip of the goopy black slime.  Revissa quickly uses her magic to conjure some vines to curl around the slimy mass and yank it and its captive host into the freezium chamber, quickly locking her in place within the frame.

“Now!” she yells, leaping away from the opening.

You nod and press the button to begin to process.  The hatch to the chamber slides shut, and you hear the whooshing of air as sublimated metal is sprayed over the knottie and the slime.  After a moment, a pleasant ding indicates the process is done, and you press the button to open up the chamber.  What you see inside is a pleasant surprise.

Ros’eela is frozen solid, naked body nicely mounted on a rectangular frame, completely embedded into the thick mass of mottled metal.  That was to be expected.  But more important than that is how she is posed.  Her hands are held out in front of her in the very traditional style of freezium victims, indicating that she must have been freed from the slime in order to move her arms to get into that position.  Which means that the goop must have been destroyed by the icy blast!

Satisfied with your ingenuity, you affix a hover-pad to Ros’eela’s body to move her, and hang her up on the wall beside the other one already there.  Unfortunately, it will not be safe to thaw her out for the next few hours at least, so she’ll have to remain trapped there for the time being while you figure out your next move.

As you ponder, you hear a beeping sound coming from the freezing device.  Looking around its back, you see that its freezium capsule has been expended and needs to be replaced.  Being the diligent technician that you are, you locate another one in a nearby crate and slot it into the machine… which is when a thought strikes you.  Though it’s not their main function, one could, theoretically, chuck one of these capsules like a grenade, shattering it at the feet of an enemy to flash-freeze them with the exploding vapor.  Definitely a useful thing to have in your back pocket.  And so you slip the last remaining capsule from the crate into your pouch and return to the mission.

If or when the Knotties are saved, you wouldn’t want them to be upset with you for using their equipment improperly.  And so, you bring up the manual for the device on its control console and look over the maintenance protocols listed.  It only takes a few minutes to go down the checklist, but the last bullet point requires you to head inside and ensure all the spray nozzles are properly cleaned of metal residue from their icy discharge. 

And so you pop inside and get to scrubbing, really getting in there to make sure everything is in top working order.  But as you work, your foot happens to bump into something hard lodged in the back of the chamber, causing it to roll backwards and klunk against the inner wall.

“Hrmm?”

You put down the tool you were using to clean, bending down to pick up the offending object.  It appears to be a small metal orb, about three inches in diameter, almost perfectly smooth and spherical.  Puzzled, you show it to Revissa, who lays a hand on it as well.

“Wait… whatever this is, it’s alive!” she exclaims.

“Alive?  But what could – wait!  Do you think… is this the slime symbiote?!”

Of course, it all makes sense.  While Ros’eela was getting frozen, it must have sloughed off her body, trying to escape the grip of the icy vapors.  But there was nowhere to run in the airtight capsule, so it collapsed in on itself and was encased in hardened metal, just like the Knottie.  Though… as you run your fingers along it more closely, you get the sense that the coating is rather thin.  A heavy impact would probably sunder the casing and free the slime monster, causing trouble for anyone nearby.

That makes it a useful, albeit dangerous, tool.  You stow it in your pack along with the freezium canister and head back out into the camp.

The only reason Ros’eela escaped capture by the pollen spitting plant was because she was unable to act on the impulses to head towards it while she was in the midst of her bondage training.  If she had been fully mobile when her arousal was at its highest, she’d have been helpless to resist its allure, and would have ended up like all the rest of the workers at the outpost.  So maybe… a bit of self-bondage is just what you need.

You could activate the ropes and restrain yourselves, working through your sexual tension until you’re no longer unbearably horny, and then escape from the bindings with some of your equipment, since these malfunctioning ropes won’t destroy your gear.  It’s an odd plan… but not totally insane.

“Oh, I agree,” you say, “but some of the best ideas are the insane ones.”

Your wife just rolls her eyes as you inspect the equipment.  Some ropes, ball gags, and leather collars - pretty standard stuff, as far as bondage material goes.  From the look of it, you can’t see any obvious flaws in the design or anything, but then again, you’re no expert in the field.

“Welp, here goes nothing.”

You find a button and press down on it, and immediately, the gear all springs to life.  The ropes animate like a nest of writhing snakes, wrapping around your ankles, your shins, and your thighs, tugging your legs out from under you and dropping you into a sitting position on the floor.  More of them catch your arms, forcing them behind your back one over the other then anchoring them to a loop secured around your waist in a box tie position.  You’re surprised by the thoroughness of these supposedly ‘defective’ products, how swiftly and completely they cut off your mobility.  But the ropes aren’t done there, with one last set twisting around your hips and digging themselves into your crotch, pressing in hard enough to make you gasp in unexpected arousal.  And that’s the opening the restraints need for one of the ball-gags to animate and quickly jam itself between your lips, securing its strap tightly around the back of your head.

Beside you, Revissa is overwhelmed in an identical manner, brought to the floor as her limbs become hopelessly entangled in the thick grip of the ropes.  She starts to make a snarky comment about how dumb an idea this was on your part, but the words never pass her lips before another gag seals off her voice.  Both of you find yourselves completely incapacitated in a matter of moments, reduced to squirming and grunting helplessly on the floor of the room.  But there’s still one last trick up these nefarious items’ sleeves, as leather collars shoot out and lock themselves around your necks, linking the two of you together with a thick strap between them.

Though there is one silver lining.  Namely that your original idea did have some merit.  As you both spend an hour squirming uselessly, you feel that pollen scent waft in from the windows and drive you both into a frenzy of arousal, compelling you both to squirm and strain and struggle to try and make your way towards its source.  But bound as you are, any sort of mobility is impossible.  All you accomplish is driving yourself to a humiliating orgasm as the crotch rope digs into your lower lips and stimulates you enough to moisten your pants.

It’s only after you’ve fully worked out your frustration that you remember that you have a tool to help you among the items in your back.  Wiggling and squirming as best you are able, you eventually manage to withdraw Vhaja’s runic dagger from within your pouch and slide it out onto the floor.  And then, with the help of the gag-talk translator, the two of you coordinate your movements well enough to eventually cut your legs free, and then finally your hands.  It takes a full hour to get it done, and none of it would have been possible if you didn’t have your equipment, or if there wasn’t a tiny bit of give in the restraints since it was pressed up against the fabric of your clothes.  Which makes you shudder to think of how helpless you would have been if the restraints weren’t defective.

But in the end you are free, and your minds both feel more clear than they had been in a while, perhaps making it safer to traverse the outpost as you search for answers.

Additional armbinders and feet sheathes prevent her from using any of her twenty digits from manipulating her restraints, and there’s even a pair of anti-grav rings pressed over the tips of her head tendrils to keep them locked into a stable position relative to her body.

And so, you reach up and loosen the gag from her lips, even as Ros’eela tries to wiggle and squirm to resist your attempts to free her.

“Put that back!” she demands once the gag is removed.  “Otherwise I’m going to have to start my training all over again!”

You back away.  “Not until you answer some questions.”

But she’s not interested in listening.  She swerves her body, somehow managing to smack herself into you and cause you to drop the gag, then she catches it with her mouth and twists her neck to get it to fasten itself back in place.  It would be impressive if it wasn’t so annoying.

“I don’t think we’re going to get through to her like this,” Revissa says with a shrug.

“Mmph?” Ros’eela replies brightly.  “Mggrgmphh-rrgmmmph.”

As she grunts into her gag, the translation device you picked up in another room helpfully hums to life, and begins to interpret her random sounds into comprehensible speech.

“Huh?  Is that Captain Melfy?  It’s been too long!” is what the device tells you she said.

You give her a brief run-down of your mission thus far, and ask her about the Knottie outpost and what their purpose is here.  It’s more or less what you expected, that they are harvesting the natural resources made of ghost matter on this planet to repurpose into bondage gear.  Revissa remains upset that they would plunder the forest, forcing you to run interference as a mediator between the two of them.

“Look, if you’ve got a problem, take it up with the forewoman, not me,” Ros’eela eventually says in exasperation.

“Forewoman?  You’re the only person we’ve found in the outpost thus far!” you reply.  

That does surprise her somewhat.  She says there should be twenty or so workers around right now, but suggests that maybe they are doing recon in the forest, or maybe just headed back to the main camp by the ruins.  Since she’s spent the last few weeks doing bondage training in this closet, she doesn’t actually have much insight to offer.  You spend some more time trying to convince her to accompany you, but she remains determined to continue her training.

Revissa is not entirely convinced this is a sane and rational choice to be making right now, but she goes along with it anyway, perhaps only for the reason that the thought of watching you squirm against some ropes is deeply erotic to her.  

And so, as Ros’eela watches with bemused interest, the two of you peel off your clothes, and gather some self-tying smart-ropes from elsewhere in the building.  Then you drag a pair of chairs into the storage room, clearing out enough space so the two of you can sit beneath the Knottie’s suspended body.

“Why exactly are we doing this?” Revissa asks, but you cut her off by pressing a bright green ball gag between her lips.

Honestly, you’re not sure why you’re doing this.  But it does make you oddly wet, thinking about how completely helpless you and your wife are going to be in a moment.  You secure your own lips with a similar bright red gag, then sit down onto one of the chairs.  With a glance towards your wife, you both tug on the smart-ropes at the same time, activating their programming to command them to start coiling around your naked, unprotesting figures.  They move with expert precision, snaking around your ankles, above and below your knees, pulling your arms behind your backs and coiling between and around your heaving breasts.  And once they are in place, they tighten, pulling themselves taut in a way that immediately makes clear you’re not going to be able to get out of this on your own.  Perhaps most distracting of all, however, is the fact that they also wind themselves between your legs, rubbing erotically against your crotch in a way that makes you mewl in pleasured surprise into your gag.

Pulling out your trusty sword, you completely sever the ropes keeping her suspended in a few expertly aimed slashes, dropping the pink cutie to the ground.

“What the hell?!” she yells, as she starts to pick up the scraps of rope you just destroyed. 

“Look, we need to talk to you!” you plead.  “There’s something going on in this outpost - it’s totally deserted, other than you.”

Ros’eela continues to fiddle with the ropes as she looks up at you.  “That’s impossible.  There were like twenty people here when I started my training two weeks ago.”

You shake your head.  “While, now there’s no one here.”

“I guess I should take a look,” she says, before making one last tug on the ropes.  And suddenly, they spring to life, whatever damage you did to them repaired, and quickly twist around your and Revissa’s bodies, binding you back-to-back as you slink to the ground.

“Punishment for ruining two weeks worth of work,” she says, before turning and leaving the room.

Luckily, the ropes are damaged enough that you’re actually able to squirm free purely with brute strength, though it still takes you a good fifteen minutes of effort.  There’s no immediate sign of Ros’eela as you exit, meaning you’re going to have to look around for her all over again.

No matter how you wiggle or squirm, you are unable to move an inch, nor can you make any effective communication with your lips sealed shut.  In short, both you and your wife have rendered yourselves completely and utterly helpless.

Ros’eela hangs above you, a bemused expression on her face, perhaps happy just to have the company.  And as you sit here, completely cut off from the outside world in your tiny little storage closet, you find the erotic tension that had slowly been building up in your body to subside.  You remain bound for the full extent of an hour before, with a deep sigh, Ros’eela finally decides to do something.

It’s honestly quite impressive to behold.  The way someone so completely restrained can twist and gyrate and squirm with such expert technique and precision to somehow loosen, then unfurl the ropes so snugly wound around her body.  But Ros’eela does just that.  For something that would have been beyond impossible for you, she accomplishes it in about five minutes, untying herself and landing on the ground like an acrobat after a gymnastics routine.

“So… you think there’s trouble in the air, eh?” she says after pulling out her gag.

You and Revissa nod.

“And I guess you wanna fix it?”

“Mmmphh…” you murmur gruffly.  “Hrbmpgghhh.”

“Sheesh, such foul language,” Ros’eela says with mock disgust, apparently perfectly capable of deciphering where exactly you told her she should stick her head tendrils.

A few minutes later, you and your wife are untied and dressed back up, ready to take on the rest of the mystery.  Ros’eela puts her clothes on as well, doing some warmup stretches and practice swings with her weapon of choice.

Ros’eela spent most of her early adulthood in the slave harem of galactic crime lord Sleeza the Slooze.  However, she eventually tired of that and conspired to escape, along with her fellow slaves, though not before stealing a magical sword from her old boss’s treasure vault.  Said sword turned out to be cursed, however, holding within it the bloodthirsty soul of a pirate queen named Jela which promptly possessed her.  Over time, however, they came to an arrangement, such that the pirate only gets control when there’s a fight.  Last you heard, Ros’eela went off to train at a Knottie monastery to gain even more control over the violent ghost, to keep it bound up within her soul to only be brought out when she specifically requested it.  Was this training you interrupted a part of that?

“Anyway, I’m still a bit stiff and drowsy,” she explains, “so I’ll mostly stay quiet and follow your lead, unless I see something I think I can help with.”

You nod.  It’s good to have the help.  With Ros’eela at your side, there’s surely more places you can get to in the outpost.

Knotties might find spiritual meaning in long-term captivity, but for you it’s mostly just boring.  Though at least the restraints seem to be made out of the planet’s Ghost Matter, meaning your physical needs are taken care of as you sit around in captivity.

It’s hard to tell time, locked in a storage closet, but after what you estimate to be a week of useless struggling, the door eventually opens to reveal a hovering security druid.  After scanning the room, it detects the three of you here, and makes an announcement in a loud, robotic voice.

“COMMAND HAS DECIDED TO ABANDON THIS OUTPOST,” it communicates with machine-like impassivity.  “ALL RESOURCES WILL THUS BE PUT INTO PERMANENT LOCK-DOWN.”

Wait… lock-down?  Permanent?  What does that mean?  Ros’eela seems to react with actual fear at this development, and frantically begins trying to squirm free of her bindings.  But the security drone moves faster, sending out some kind of signal to the electronically controlled ropes she had wrapped herself in.

“ADJUSTING ESCAPE DIFFICULTY TO LEVEL - IMPOSSIBLE.”

You can hear the ropes tightening around her, rendering even the bondage master helpless to escape.  The droid does the same to your own ropes, though you barely notice the difference, since you already couldn’t get out of even a basic-level tie.  Either way, once it is sure you are all totally secured, it floats away, leaving you and the rest of the ‘resources’ in the outpost unable to do anything but squirm.

It’s an ignominious end to an adventure that was already rather questionable in terms of the choices you made.  Because now you, your wife, and an old friend are locked away forever in a closet in an abandoned outpost, with no hope of escaping.  

For the first few weeks, you hold out hope that maybe the rest of your crew would somehow track you down.  But as the time passes, no one ever comes.  Maybe they got captured elsewhere by some other peril on this planet, or maybe they simply weren’t able to find you and were forced to leave.  Either way, it seems like a single poor decision is going to be the last one you ever make, because now the rest of your life is going to be spent here, bundled up and forgotten.

You are left being fearful of that very real possibility for several days before Krysta finally shows up and finds you, having a good laugh at your expense before bringing you back to your ship.

You’d think it would get easier with time, but no, your mind is every bit as addled by the effects of the aphrodisiac as it was when you first stepped foot into this clearing.  So it seems you have no choice but to once again subject yourself to some self-bondage, lest you get so overwhelmed you wander towards the giant flower and end up encased in amber.

“Are we really doing this?  *Again*?” Revissa asks in exasperation, eyeing the box of forbidden bondage equipment suspiciously.

“What other choice do we have?” you counter.  “If we’re not tied up when we get overcome with horniness, we’ll be drawn to the flower.”

In the end, she’s forced to agree.  So you open the box and lay out the gear, making sure that your rope-cutting knife is safely tucked into your belt, easily within reach.  You don’t need to waste another two hours in bondage - you just need to be able to safely orgasm without being pulled towards your doom.  

“Well, here goes nothing!” you yell, pressing down on the button to the rope.  And, like before, it springs to life like a hempen snake, swiftly curling around your limbs.

A familiar rush of erotic pleasure washes over you as you tumble to the ground, moaning with delight as the ropes start to press themselves against your skin.  In a moment you’re totally restrained, arms behind your back, legs bent, body churning against the taut lines digging into your crotch.  But then… something different happens.  The bristles on the rope begin to sizzle and glow, tiny nano-fibers shifting to activate a function that was supposed to be out of order, and in no time flat, every scrap of clothing is evaporated from your body, leaving you totally naked and completely without a viable weapon.

“Wha?” you murmur in confusion, before an animated gag slaps itself between your lips, sealing away your voice.

At this point your grunts of arousal give way, briefly, to fear, but they are incomprehensible since the gag-talk translator was destroyed along with everything else in your pack.  But that panic doesn’t last long, as a pair of stimulation devices emerge from the container, slipping themselves into your sex and switching on to the maximum setting.  You’re so overwhelmed from the sensation, you don’t even notice as spools of tape wrap around your hands, turning them into useless mittens that would be unable to pick up a tool to cut yourself free, if you had one.

You would answer… but you’re a bit distracted by other things at the moment.  If you weren’t, you might have noticed a second set of ropes slithering towards your flustered wife.

“Ack!” is all she can say, before they are upon her.  Revissa puts up as much of a fight as you did when you were caught - which is to say, no fight at all.  In a matter of seconds she’s been thrown to the ground, clothing and gear dissolved, naked skin completely bundled up in rope.

All you can do is let your eyes roll back and surrender to it.  At some point, the two sets of bondage gear decide to link up, attaching a strap between the collars around each of your necks to link the two of you together, to force you both to keep adding to the other’s stimulation by combining your body heat into a single, pulsating, thrumming nexus of bliss.

It seems this batch wasn’t all defective.  Because these ropes are working properly in completely dominating the both of you, reducing you to bundled up captives with no chance in hell of ever escaping your plight.

If or when the Knotties are saved, you wouldn’t want them to be upset with you for using their equipment improperly.  And so, you bring up the manual for the device on its control console and look over the maintenance protocols listed.  It only takes a few minutes to go down the checklist, but the last bullet point requires you to head inside and ensure all the spray nozzles are properly cleaned of metal residue from their icy discharge. 

All the work makes you build up quite the sweat.  As you move to wipe some of it from your brow, you can’t help but notice Revissa lounging against the entrance to the chamber with a sultry smile on her lips.  

“Enjoying the view?” you ask, flexing a bit for her.

“Always,” she says with a low purr.

You’ve never been able to resist her when she gets that look in her eyes.  Especially not now, when all that pollen in the air has been making you excessively horny.  So can you really be held responsible when you make a big show of sliding out of your shirt to let her ogle your rippling muscles as you get back to work?  And can *she* really be to blame for taking the bait and coming inside, for pressing herself up against you alluringly, for feeling the tautness of your toned abdomen against her skin?  

How could you have possibly known that freezium chambers of Knottie design have a lever *inside* the machine that activates the cooling process?  Their design philosophy as a species really does seem to be all about finding ways to imperil themselves, doesn’t it?  Of course, if you *had* known about that lever, you might have been able to muster up enough self-restraint to avoid it, but instead when Revissa starts nibbling on your ear you reach up for something to wrap your fingers around and accidentally give it a tug.

If there’s any silver lining, it’s that what happens next comes so quickly you don’t really have time to fully realize how monumental of a screw-up you had just made.  The hatch swings shut, the machine hums to life, and super-chilled metal vapor flows from the recently-cleaned nozzles with frightening efficiency, washing over the bodies of you and your wife just as you pull her in to lock lips.  And then there’s only an immense feeling of cold, the sound of clothing becoming brittle and flaking away, the hiss of steam and the hum of electronics, and then nothing at all as you’re locked into a state of suspended animation.

But now, nothing you do or say has any impact on what happens to you next, because freezium-coated cuties have no agency of their own.

Maybe they got caught by some other peril on the planet, or maybe they searched for as long as they could before eventually giving up.  You’ll never know.

It’s several hundred years before you’re discovered by chance by a passing explorer.  The prefab buildings have mostly crumbled and withered away, reclaimed by the elements, only a few vine-choked walls remaining of the doomed outpost.  But freezium doesn’t decay, so you and Revissa and the two helpless Knotties are as solid as the day you were first preserved, inert slabs of metal caked in dirt and moss.  

Had you been lucky, you’d have been found by a kind soul.  But luck was never your strong suit.  You’re found by a pirate, who sells you and the others to a private collector, where you’re mounted on the walls of her private gallery. She has no intention of ever letting you go, so she removes the display frame from the freezium slab, which also has the mechanism to thaw you out, and also coats you in some glossy sealant that makes restoration significantly more difficult.  

And so begins your new life as nothing but a bauble in someone’s collection, put on display without any knowledge of who you were or what you had done.  In the end, one thoughtless mistake ended your entire career, erased your mark on history, and doomed you and your wife to an eternity of suspended animation.

The data collection device was damaged beyond repair when you were frozen, making the mission a complete failure, so there was no reason to stay.

In the end, one thoughtless mistake screwed up everything, though at least you avoided an eternity of suspended animation in your freezium shell.  Maybe next time you’ll be more careful.

As your fingers fumble for clasps and buttons, tugging at cloth and pulling at boots, undoing the buckle on a belt and dropping your earthly possessions to the forest floor.  Petal watches with interest as you and Revissa disrobe, helpfully flinging droplets of her nectar onto your discarded items to dissolve them into steam.  How kind of her - after all, you won’t be needing any of that stuff anymore.  Clothes and weapons and data devices are trappings of your old life, equipment whose purpose you no longer even remember.  All that matters now is to do what she tells you, to make her happy, to bring a smile to her wonderful face.

“I like the looks of your bodies,” she says warmly, long plant tendrils extending from her flower home to gently caress your exposed figures.  “But I bet the two of you like each other even more than that.”

A tender nudge of a vine directs you and Revissa to look into each other’s eyes.  And a puff of pollen against your nostrils and a droplet of sweet nectar between your lips is all that it takes to inform you of what it is you must do.  With sluggish, but confident steps, you move towards your wonderful wife, wrapping your arms around her waist as both of you drop to your knees.  Warm bodies meld into a single entity, hungry lips eagerly joining together as you lose yourselves in each other’s embrace.

You are vaguely aware of more honeyed words from the beautiful plant-woman, but you’re too busy exploring Revissa’s heaving body to give them any mind.  As such, you are not prepared for the steady drip-drip-drip of fragrant plant sap as it pours over your body - not that it really matters anyway.  Because you know what you need to do.  You need to keep kissing, keep grinding, keep moaning, even as that deluge of nectar starts to congeal and harden, even as it forms an impenetrable amber shell to encase your bodies and preserve you in your moment of unbridled passion.

Presumably, there are still things happening outside.  The Knottie outpost becomes abandoned after all its occupants lost contact with the main camp.  And your own crew never shows up to extract you, though whether that is because they simply have no idea where you were, or that they have fallen afoul of some other peril on the planet is impossible to tell.

Either way, the fact remains, that you and Revissa remain here, ummoving, and mostly unthinking.  The lovely plant lady who put you here seems to have moved on to greener pastures, happy to have fertilized the soil with all the runoff from your resin-coated sexual tension - not that you’re aware of that being her reasoning.  And as the days go on, all blending into one another, stretching on into infinity, that is all you’ll ever be, just another block of amber left alone in the deep, deep forest.

It’s not until many months later that your amber shell finally thaws out, and you and Revissa are able to collapse into each other and melt into a puddle of orgasmic bliss.  Later, you’ll learn that thanks to your Star Scout homing beacon, Vhaja and the rest of the crew were able to track you down and extract your amber-encased bodies from the forest.  Though after that it took a long process of searching for a way to actually remove you from the nigh-indestructible nectar.  Eventually you were brought to the Squira druids of Del Thora, a remote planet whose trademark sacred sap has many similar properties to the plant resin, and with their techniques you were returned to life.

Of course, the rescue and restoration process meant the actual mission had to be abandoned, not the least reason for which is the data collection device was destroyed along with your gear and clothing.  And so as your crew breaks up again and goes their separate ways, you can only wonder how things might have gone had you been able to keep your libido in check.

And clearly, the bridge is always going to be the best place to start.  After confirming the location on the map, you and Revissa head there, finding the entrance at the end of the hallway.

As soon as you step through the door, you are assaulted by a sickly-sweet smell in the air, thick and cloying and almost mind-numbingly pleasant.  The culprit seems to be the ship’s air circulation system, because as you glance up at the air vents you can see there is some kind of plant growth coming in through it, full of beautifully flowering vines.  A powerful pollen wafts from the flowers, filling the room with a haze of yellowish dust, causing you to sneeze as you accidentally get a full whiff of it.

“This is… ahhh…” murmurs Revissa.  “Some kind of… aphrodisiac…”

“It’s real… nice…” you whisper in response, feeling an indescribable warmth filling your body.

It is at this point that you look down and discover what happened to cause Ros’eela to be delayed.  She breathed in the same pollen that the two of you did, and, overcome by horniness, appears to have activated some kind of emergency enviro-suit feature on the bridge, which has encased her body in a tight layer of plastic wrap.

Sealed in tight, her fingers play with her lower lips, while the upper ones are nicely fitted with a tight blue ball gag.  She looks up at you with half-lidded eyes, moaning helplessly as she succumbs to the intensity of the pleasure.

“Oh… wow…” you say weakly, already pawing at your clothes.  “That’s… really… hot…”

Revissa nods, slipping out of her garments and letting them drop to the floor.  “Do you think… you can… get that working for… us… too?”

You glance at the blinking light for the emergency enviro-suit dispenser.  It seems simple enough.  Just press the button and stand in front of it to get fitted.

Though overcome by arousal, you still have a measure of chivalry left in your mind, so you motion for Revissa to go in first.

]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="298" name="FC02HC" tags="" position="3825,1125" size="100,100">Just as you are about to turn away from the locked door, you remember something.  Namely, that Ros’eela found a data pad near the construction equipment that she said had belonged to her boss, the ship’s captain.  You pull it out now, and page through the interface, finding a connectivity app that links to the ship’s main systems.  And though there aren’t any options to open just the one door to the room ahead of you, there *is* an option to initiate a total reboot of all containment measures, which will also unlock all restricted areas on the ship.

Well, that seems as good a choice as any.  You click the button and are rewarded with a satisfying hiss as the door whooshes open, allowing you to walk inside.

Of course, being the daring sort that you are, you step in first, walking into a room illuminated only by the sultry mood lighting of a lava lamp on a table next to a heart-shaped bed laying in the middle of the room.  Well then… it seems the captain of this ship is more of a lover than a fighter.  You spend a few minutes searching the chamber, but don’t end up turning up anything of use.  Disappointed, you’re about to turn and leave, when you notice a data stick sitting in the middle of the bed.  Jackpot!

Unfortunately… when you crawl onto the bed to retrieve it, you activate some kind of automatic function inherent to the piece of furniture.  Suddenly you see a clear film spreading out from the sides of the bed, wrapping over you and shifting your limbs into an embarrassingly open pose before you have a chance to react.  This is followed by a pulse of energy to evaporate your clothing (*again*), leaving you naked and utterly restrained in a vacuum-sealed sheathe atop the bed.

You sigh as you squirm helplessly against the material.  It would figure that this is how a Knottie captain would relax when she was off duty.  Revissa can barely contain her amusement as she watches you struggle, eventually deciding to add insult to injury by walking to the foot of the bed and pressing the end of her staff between your legs.  What follows is several minutes of intense stimulation that leads to you climaxing loudly and messily inside the plastic seal, which, ironically, proves to be exactly the right call.  Because as soon as you finish, the plastic automatically retracts, its job done, leaving you panting and exhausted atop the bed.

But at least you got that damn data stick.  After you clean yourself up and use another synthesizer capsule to repair your clothing, you insert the stick into a computer console and bring up the last few entries in the captain’s personal log files.  In them, she talks about the harvesting operations, quoting productivity metrics and the like, as well as her theories about some strange substance a scout team found in the cavern area that has some promising qualities to it.  However, she also complains about a dip in efficiency as her crew starts becoming increasingly horny as the days pass (even hornier than *normal* Knottie operations, you think to yourself bemusedly).  In the last entry, she says she has discovered the source of this horniness, that pollen from the local plants seem to have aphrodisiac properties, and that a particularly large one has just cropped up in the center of the clearing where they are working.  She says she’s going to send some crew to prune the offending plant, as well as get someone to work on the ship’s ventilation system since it seems to have gotten clogged up lately.

And that’s all the information you find.  Altogether not as useful as you might have liked, but at least now you know why you’ve been feeling so horny whenever you walk around outside, and that the large flower is the source of it.  Definitely something to keep in mind for the future.

But you still haven’t found Ros’eela.  So it seems like you’ll have to do some more searching.

Presumably, the suit-fitting process is meant to include some sort of helmet as well, since the wrapping stops when it climbs to Revissa’s neck.  But you see nothing to that effect nearby - or maybe the ball-gag Ros’eela is wearing is somehow the breathing apparatus?  You’re honestly not sure, and if you were thinking properly, you would wonder how exactly whatever this machine is doing would be a useful feature for a starship to have.  But you’re *not* thinking straight.  In fact, you’re barely able to contain your growing arousal as the bound-up Revissa flops over onto the floor next to Ros’eela, moaning passionately as she pleasures herself in her bondage.

You can think of nothing else but wanting to join her.  And so, you walk up to the machine as well, frantically pounding on the button to dispense a lovely cling-film of your own.  But perhaps you shouldn’t have hit it so hard.  Because instead of getting a spinning layer of film wrapped around your legs, the machine instead spits out a thick, net-like sheet of plastic at high velocity, a rectangular mat of clear film that slams into you with enough force to knock you back against the wall.  When you strike the surface the plastic net sticks there, held in place by powerful adhesives that effectively glue you into place in a tidy, vacuum-sealed sheathe.]

But on the other, the incredible pressure of the tightly sealed plastic hugging your every curve feels *amazing*.  In fact, you find you’re able to stimulate yourself just by gyrating your body and massaging your skin against the material, prompting you to roll your eyes back and moan as you reach the first of many climaxes.

And so, the three of you completely succumb to the unintentionally laid trap on the bridge, naked, restrained, and unable to concentrate on anything other than pleasure for even a moment, giving you no time to even consider the prospect of escape.  Which means none of you will be going anywhere else any time soon.

“Ohh… that looks… fun…” Revissa murmurs, her legs quivering.  She begins pawing at her clothing, desperate to have what Ros’eela is having.

And you have to admit… it *is* pretty hot.  But your head is still on straight enough to realize that self-bondage on a Knottie starship is not exactly the best idea, especially when you’re in the middle of a mission.  Though if you hadn’t just been stimulated to completion in the captain’s quarters, you might not have had the presence of mind to realize it.

The important thing, you decide, is getting your allies away from that horniness dust.  And so you scoop Ros’eela up in your arm and sling her over your shoulder, then take Revissa by the hand and lead her away.  When you duck into the quarters you just exited, she gets an excited look in her eye, making you realize too late the idea you were giving her.  Before you can react your wife has pounced on top of you, slathering you with touches and kisses that make your mind blank out entirely.  But at least you did it while not in the room filled with pollen, so that after a half hour of love-making everyone’s feeling a bit more level-headed.

You eventually get yourself dressed again, and manage to cut Ros’eela out of her plastic seal.  

“Sorry… got a bit distracted,” she admits.  I came to the bridge to deactivate the security drones and then… well… that stuff made me totally black out, and all I could think about was wanting to make myself as helpless as possible.”

Good thing you didn’t join her, otherwise there wouldn’t be anyone left to get you free.  

“I’d have loved to have brought up the security footage so that we could have seen what happened to everyone else, but with the bridge full of pollen like that, I don’t think I’ll be able to concentrate long enough to put in the codes for it,” Ros’eela continues.  “Oh, but wait… you have the captain’s data pad, right?  In that case, maybe we can transfer command authority from the bridge here to her quarters.”

You hand her the device and let her do just that.  With a few clicks, she accomplishes her goal, and manages to bring up some camera recordings from the past few weeks.

At first you just think it’s some kind of puddle of oil or tar that has spilled out onto the floor.  But then you see that the puddle of black gunk isn’t remaining stationary.  It’s moving, flowing around the room, oozing in directions that aren’t randomly determined, but chosen with deadly purpose.  A small, fuzzy woodland creature gets overtaken by the blob and coated with the thick tar, which clings to the critter like glue and forms a firm rubber shell around its body.  And then the critter falls to the floor and writhes, completely encased and immobilized by the goopy menace.

Not good.  This thing must be some kind of slime-like predator!  Leave it to the Knotties to keep something so dangerous locked up in a lab that could be released with a single accidental press of a button.

“We need to do something!” Revissa yells, pulling out her staff and preparing a spell.

You nod at her, attempting to draw your sword.  But before your hand even curls around the hilt, the ooze monster suddenly changes direction, perhaps picking up on the sound of your voices.  It flows with terrifying quickness towards the two of you, even somehow ejecting some globs of itself from its main mass at high velocity towards your bodies.  You don’t even have time to process what’s happening before a gob of rubbery sludge catches you by the wrist, preventing you from getting a hold of your weapon.

“Wha — grrmmphg!” Revissa yells in surprise, as a similar projectile gloms over her lips, cutting off her ability to finish casting her spell.

Crap, there’s no explanation for why it targeted the two of you that way other than that this black puddle of moving tar is somehow intelligent!  And that it sees the two of you as potential prey.

“We need to get out of here!” you tell, using your good hand to take Revissa by the wrist and pull her back towards the door you came in through.

But the slime monster is faster.  It races ahead of you, sloshing its way between you and the exit, cutting off your retreat.  Not good at all.  Your mind races, wondering whether it would be smarter to make a run for it and try to barge past it, or back away and try to find something in the lab to help you fight it. 

Sadly, it becomes a moot point.  Because once it has limited your movement, the slime goes in for the kill.  It oozes upwards, forming itself into a kind of thin, rectangular sheet of dribbling rubber, high enough to stretch itself fully between the floor and ceiling, and then it rushes forwards.  

There’s nowhere to run.  The room is too cramped to avoid it.  It forms itself into a barrier of goop and advances, forcing both of you back against the wall.  All you can do is hold your hands up in a pathetic attempt at resistance before it melds itself over you, gluing you and your wife firmly against the surface behind you.  You feel a sickening splort as it molds itself in place, locking both of you inside of it and lifting you off your feet.

You can’t move, can’t speak, can’t even see as your vision gives way to a churning black tar that blots out all light from the room around you.

Knotties working with the heavy equipment to cut down and process the raw materials of the forest to be stored, shipped, and repurposed into bondage equipment.  Revissa seethes with annoyance as she watches the trees collapse, and as captured animals are taken to the slaughter, but manages to control herself enough to not turn into a dinosaur again.  Though you can tell that she’s really close to it.

After a while, you notice one of the workers suddenly just put down her tools and wander off, not saying a word to her compatriots, so you ask Ros’eela to change to a different camera log to follow her path.  She ends up wandering into the middle of the clearing, to the spot where you  saw that giant flower surrounded by hunks of amber.  However, in the recording, there’s no amber.  At least… not yet.  Before your eyes, you see the hapless Knottie start to disrobe, her body moving in a lethargic daze, and then stand there as coiling vines emerge from the flower and wrap around her.  She’s lifted up into the air, her eyes rolled back, her lips pursed in pleasure, as a slick nectar flows from the vines and coats her body.  After several minutes, that nectar hardens into a solid cluster of pure amber, fully encasing the woman inside of it like a prehistoric fly.  

“Well… that explains what happened to everyone…” Ros’eela says with a frown.  “I guess everyone was charmed by that plant and got gooped.  We’ve got to do something about this!  This is unforgivable - how dare those plants trap them without tying them up first”

Revissa grumbles.  “*That’s* what you’re upset about?”

“Look, I might not be the best example of my species, but even I have standards,” the Knottie replies.

You just shake your head in exasperation as you watch the video. 

“So it looks like the plants control people with their pollen.  That would explain why I’ve been so horny ever since I entered the area, even from a distance that pollen is affecting us.  And I guess that explains why Ros’eela was fine - she was tied up the whole time so she couldn’t get drugged into going towards the plant, even if she wanted to.”

“See?  My bondage training paid off!” Ros’eela says proudly.  “Anyway, it looks like if we get too close we’ll totally lose our minds, but we can’t save everyone if we don’t get close.  I wonder if there’s some way around that.  If you girls have any ideas, I’m all ears.  But for now I think I am going to hang back here and see if I can’t contact HQ for some help.”

That seems reasonable.  At this point, you could consider the mystery no longer your problem, since Ros’eela is calling it in to her bosses, though it would probably be the heroic thing to do to keep poking around.  And though she’s going to stay on the ship for the time being, Ros’eela would probably be willing to at least accompany you to the science lab before you head outside.

Of course, actually accomplishing that is easier said than done.  But after you share your thoughts, Revissa comes up with a plan.  Breaking away from you, she transforms herself into an adorable green monkey, only about two feet tall, and begins leaping around the tables and equipment in the room, making a raucous shrieking sound and throwing random objects into the slimy creature’s body.  And that seems to have the intended effect of drawing its attention towards her, causing the monster to keep spitting goopy blasts of liquid rubber in her direction.  But as a monkey, she is faster.  She always manages to leap to the side at the very last minute, frustrating the relentless monster and making it reckless.  Until finally, the creature launches its entire gelatinous form at her, hoping by sheer volume it will be able to connect with her.

And it might have, had you not grabbed her by the tail and yanked her away right before it hit her, causing the monster to instead fly right into one of the containment cells.  Quickly you pull out the tablet and re-activate security protocols, once again trapping it inside an energy barrier.

Success!  Though that doesn’t help at all with rescuing Ros’eela.  Your pink friend is still entirely encased in a sheathe of latex, squirming helplessly in the creature’s grasp.  Sadly, you have no better ideas on how to proceed, so for the time being you have Revissa turn back to humanoid form and load the Knottie up into an air-tight storage crate, locking the lid shut with a hiss of steam.  Not the best solution, but the only one you can come up with at the moment.

And now it’s just the two of you again.  The question remains what to do about the pollen-spitting plant and the rest of the Knotties in the outpost, not to mention Ros’eela who is still helplessly writhing in the storage container.

“Revissa… try dumping some of these random containers on it and see if it reacts to anything!” you yell.

Your wife nods, conjuring plant vines to sprout up from the ground and grab onto various test tubes full of chemicals and crates with harvested materials, overturning them and dumping them into the gooey creature’s sticky mass.

As each object drops in, it gets absorbed with a sickening *splort*.  Some wood chip samples dissolve uselessly, as do several strips of dried and cured leather.  A vial of river water does nothing, nor does a hunk of amber.  Just when it seems like you’re out of luck, Revissa knocks over a small refrigeration unit onto the slime which, much to your delight, causes it to suddenly slow down in its movement.

“Wait… cold!” you yell.  Of course!  You vaguely recall a story from years ago about a slime symbiote that was weak to low temperatures.  This thing must work the same way.  Looking around, you see a feed line for some industrial coolant gas on the wall.  And you’re just about to point it out when something among the cocktail of chemicals within the slime creature causes it to violently erupt.

You and Revissa have only a moment to hold up your hands in surprise before a wave of sticky slime slams into you both and shoves you up against the wall, pinning you there beneath a thin but taut rubbery sheathe.  It holds fast, completely cutting off your movement, vacuum sealing you to the spot with no way to get out.

But up until now, you’ve ignored the giant flower in the center, surrounded by hunks of amber resin.  Maybe it was just some kind of sixth sense that warned you away from it, some deep-seated knowledge born from the many adventures you’ve survived up until now.  But whatever it is, after seeing the recorded footage on the ship, you know it was the right call.  If you got too close, you’d be overwhelmed by the scent of pollen and doused in quick-drying nectar, frozen in place with no chance of getting out on your own.

So given all that, one might find it rather puzzling why you would now choose to approach the giant flower.  But there’s nothing strange about it.  Despite everything, you do somewhat fashion yourself as a hero.  When push comes to shove, you try to do the right thing.  Revissa might not be happy with what these Knotties are doing to the forest, but they don’t deserve to be trapped forever like flies in amber.  So you’ve decided the only thing to do is to rescue them.  At least you know about the pollen, and that you need to keep your wits about you when the plant starts to try and lure you in.

“Hold on a moment,” Revissa says, lightly grabbing your wrist as you approach.  “Let me do a quick spell.”

She rifles through her bag for some bright red berries, then crushes them between her finger, reaching out to lightly brush some of the pulp on each of your foreheads.

“It only lasts for a few minutes, but it should make us a bit more resistant to mind-altering effects,” she explains.  “But *not* immune… so please try to keep your libido in check.”

You knew what to expect, but you still have to stifle a gasp when you notice it.  Though the hardened chunks of sap are mostly opaque, when you get close enough you can see past the surface to what lies inside.  Each piece of resin holds a woman trapped inside of it, all of them bearing the distinctive head tendrils of the Knottie species.  The women are nude, and have expressions on their faces ranging from surprised, to relaxed, to aroused.  None of them are moving, which isn’t surprising, though at least they don’t appear to be in any immediate danger.  

“They’re alive,” Revissa confirms, laying her hand on the smooth surface of one of the amber stones.  “This is made of the same Ghost Matter as the rest of the stuff on this planet, so they’ll be safe and healthy for as long as they’re in there.”

“Can they be freed?” you ask, casting a suspicious eye around the area for any signs of movement from the flower that did this to them.

Revissa shakes her head.  “It’s… really strong stuff, I am pretty sure.  Conventional weapons would be useless against it.  But maybe the Squira priestesses of Del Thora would be able to do something.  They make use of a Sacred Sap in their rituals that has similar properties.”

On the one hand, they’re not stuck forever.  On the other, it means that there’s probably no tools you have in your arsenal here that can rescue anyone caught in the stuff.  Which means your best bet to finding out how to free them would be examining the flower itself.

It is exactly when that thought crosses your mind that you hear the rustle of leaves from behind you.  The sweet scent of pollen grows thicker and stronger, filling your nostrils with a fragrant aroma that sends your mind reeling - though Revissa’s blessing helps you resist the worst of it for now.  Turning around, you see the massive flower fronds start to unfurl from the center of the giant plant, revealing an unexpected sight at their center.

She has rich green skin, short, fluffy hair with the texture of leaves, and a curvaceous figure that extends down to the thighs before it vanishes into the center of the petals of the giant flower.  The interior of her flower is filled with more of that amber liquid, the same as the stuff all the Knotties are encased in, sloshing around whenever she moves, creating a powerful, honey-sweet scent even more overwhelming than the airborne pollen.  

Despite everything, you still find yourself speechless before her.  Every fiber of your being is telling you to submit, to surrender, to give yourself over to the bewitching plant woman.  Revissa seems a bit more equipped to answer, stepping forward with her arms held up diplomatically.

“Greetings, noble protector of the forest,” your wife says.  “We apologize for the intrusion.  And… I just want to let you know that we – that I, sympathize with your plight.

They have cut down trees, they have slain animals, they have disrupted the natural ecosystem.  They have intruded in a place where they do not belong–”

“Hrmm…” the plant woman says with a frown, interrupting her.  “It’s true… they didn’t belong here.  But it’s okay!  Now they do!  They’re part of the forest now, and they’ll stay that way forever!”

The use of the word ‘forever’ certainly sets off alarm bells.  Yet even still, you find yourself transfixed by her beauty.  Revissa, too, is struggling to maintain her composure.

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

“Melfy,” you murmur weakly.  You stare up, transfixed by the intensity of her eyes, the softness of her skin.

“Revissa Bloomtender,” your wife says more firmly.  She steps forward to interpose herself between you and the plant woman.

Petal tilts her head curiously to the side.  “Are you upset with me?” she asks, her voice dripping with what seems like sincere concern.

“No… not exactly,” Revissa murmurs, though even her voice is starting to waver.  Being this close to the source of that pollen is intoxicating.  “But… these women… you can’t just… keep them here.”

“Oh, is that all?” Petal says, relief evident in her voice.  “Don’t worry!  I completely can!  They won’t be going anywhere, but they’ll be safe, and happy, and useful!  Here, I’ll show you.”

You feel leafy vines begin to curl around your body, and you have just enough presence of mind to realize what she is saying.  She thought Revissa’s complaint was a question of practicality - that she couldn’t physically contain all those women safely - rather than a moral one.  And she’s about to prove it by doing the same to both of you!

Normally, your first instinct would be to prepare for battle, reach for your sword or blaster pistol, maybe snarl and bare your teeth in challenge.  But you do none of those things.  Instead, you just turn around, a placid smile on your face as your nostrils fill with a saccharine scent that dulls your senses and lulls you into a placid, compliant daze.  And you look up into a pair of beautiful, nurturing eyes.

“Hello…” you say happily.

“We’re sorry… for the intrusion…” Revissa adds weakly, her eyes as blank and submissive as yours.  “We were… trying to figure… what happened to these women…”

The two of you have completely fallen under the spell of this beautiful plant woman.  She has rich green skin, short, fluffy hair the texture of leaves, and a curvaceous body that extends down to the thighs before it vanishes into the center of the petals of the giant flower.  The interior of her flower is filled with more of that amber liquid, sloshing around whenever she moves, creating the powerful, honey-sweet scent that so effectively rendered you and your wife into compliant slaves.

Ros’eela looks between the two of you, realizing you’ve both become completely infatuated.  And though she’s been influenced by the mind-altering pollen as well, the sight of her compatriots trapped in amber gives her enough courage to start to reach for her sword.

“You… have to let them… go!” she demands, fumbling with the blade to activate the enchantment on it that lets it glow with spectral power.  But her movements are slow and sluggish, her resolve already starting to waver.

“Hrmm…” the plant woman says with a frown.  “It’s true… they didn’t belong here at first.  But it’s okay!  Now they do!  They’re part of the forest now, and they’ll stay that way forever!”

With a twitch of her head, a vine whips out from the base of her giant flower, quickly wrapping around Ros’eela’s legs and pulling her up into the air.  She lets out a yelp of surprise, dropping her blade in the confusion as tendrils snake around her body, ripping away her clothes and wrapping her up tightly as she is hung upside down in front of green woman&#39;s body.]

“But I understand that you’re worried for them.  I just want you to know that it’s okay.  They’ll be safe here, and happy!  And you can join them.”

All her bravado has faded away, reducing the Knottie to a weakly mewling captive, helpless and compliant.  A state that she only falls deeper into as the plant woman begins to slather one of her head-tails with some of her fragrant nectar.

“See?  This is how they feel right now.  How they’ll feel forever.  This isn’t so bad, right?”

She takes Ros’eela by the cheeks and looks deeply in her eyes, and the Knottie can only manage to nod weakly in agreement.  

“Wonderful!  Now, let’s get you inside.”

There is no further resistance as Ros’eela is dragged towards the amber chunk holding the other two of her kin.  The plant woman brushes a vine against the surface of the resin, somehow turning a portion of it to a gelatinous state.  This allows her to shove the pink-skinned woman inside, the honey-like stone accepting her as if she was always meant to be there.  The vine takes a moment to insert itself into Ros’eela’s lower lips, pleasuring her to climax before withdrawing.  When it leaves, the gooey portion solidifies once more, trapping the Knottie inside in a perpetual orgasm.]

“See?  That wasn’t so bad!’  She claps her hands, then turns towards you and Revissa.  

Despite the scene you had just witnessed, the two of you remain completely under her spell.  The very idea of resistance is unthinkable.  There’s nowhere you’d rather be than here, no one you’d rather be looking at than this gorgeous woman.

“My name is Petal,” the woman says after a moment, reaching down to brush a hand over each of your cheeks.  “What are your names?”

Slowly, you open your lips to tell her, but strangely, you can’t remember.  You can’t remember anything at all.  Why you’re here, where you came from - none of it.  And so you just stare blankly, an apologetic look on your face, sorry for letting her down.  But then she smiles, and its as if everything in the world is right again.

“Oh… that’s okay.  Names aren’t that important anyway.  Now why don’t we get you two out of those clothes, and then we can find a place for you to fit into this forest as well?”

It fills you with an indescribable joy, to know that Petal would want to allow you to remain here in the forest with her.  Even after you’ve been so rude, forgetting your name like that.  And so you readily comply, lamely fumbling with boots and belts and shirts and pants, dropping weapons and equipment that you no longer even know the purpose of.  When you’ve finally got everything off, Petal gives you a nod of appreciation that makes your heart swell with pride, and then makes a motion for you to hold still.  Of course, you comply.

You and Revissa stand there as long, leafy tendrils extend from the bottom of her flower, wrapping around you and tightly restraining your limbs.  They feel taut and secure, too strong for you to break out of - though that’s a moot point, since you’d never want to run away from your new favorite person in the world.  Looking between the two of you, she decides to start with your wife, hoisting her up into the air and then dunking her upside down into the center of the pool of sap inside her flower, making sure to cover every inch of her body.  When she’s pulled out, her face is in a placid state of relaxment, all ounce of tension or worry banished from her frame.  She draws Revissa in for a long, lusty kiss, then suspends her in the air, allowing more and more of her nectar to drip down her vines to continue coating her.

“And now it’s your turn,” she says brightly, the very sound of her voice filling you with an indescribable warmth.  

The vines holding you yank you upwards, getting no resistance from you as you’re brought in close.

“And down you go!”

As you’re dunked into her nectar, you feel the sweet amber liquid fill your throat, feel it drip down to your stomach then flow through the rest of your body to circulate the warmth and calmness it brings.  It makes you feel nothing but joy.  You sigh in delight as your worries, your fears, your life before this moment all melt away, leaving you as nothing but a vessel for pleasure and contentment as she draws you in for your kiss.]

Her lips are soft yet firm, warm and inviting, infinitely calming.  You surrender every aspect of your being to that kiss, give her all of what you are and ever will be.  She seems to enjoy that.  As she draws back from the kiss, she tenderly caresses your cheek, then casts her eyes around the clearing.

“Now then… where to put this one…”

Just looking at her makes your body burn with desire, and her voice is so soft and soothing.  You want to be with her; you *need* to be with her.  But… some part of you knows that’s just the aphrodisiacs talking.  That this close to her, your mind is not your own.  And beside you, you can see even Revissa is starting to fall prey to it.

It’s rare, but every once in a while, you find the strength to step up and fight back.  This is one of those times.  As Petal’s leafy vines begin to curl around the two of you, you realize if you don’t act fast, you won’t be acting at all.  So you reach for your sword and free it from its sheath, making a wide swing that severs the green tendrils climbing up your body.

“Ow!” Petal yells, her beautiful face twisting into a snarl of rage and pain.  “Why… why would you do that?!”

Seeing her upset makes your heart tear in half, fills you with shame.  How could you let this happen?  But… no, you need to be strong.  Otherwise you’re going to end up as just another block of amber.

“Let us… go!” you yell.  “We don’t… want to be here…”

Petal tilts her head in confusion.  

“You don’t?” she asks, directing the question towards Revissa.

Your wife hesitates for a moment.  She looks over her shoulder towards you, then back towards the plant woman, her voice wavering.

“I… I don’t… I don’t want… to… to…” she murmurs.

Petal’s face shifts to one of disappointment, like of a parent scolding a child.

“Of course you do!” she asserts, moving a hand in her direction.  And then the vines snaring Revissa climb higher, stripping away her clothing and pulling her down to her knees.  She tries to call out again, but more tendrils snake across her lips, cutting off her voice, as others twist between her legs, pulling in against her crotch to make her face turn red and her body twitch with helpless pleasure.  “See?  She’s so happy to be here!”

Seeing your wife suffer brings you back to your senses, at least for the moment.  You can’t let things end like this.  You don’t get the sense Petal is full of malice or hatred towards you, but that doesn’t change the fact she intends to keep you here as her prisoners.  You’ve got to stop her!  And the only way to do that is to fight.

The cloying swirl of pollen and the overwhelming scent of nectar are clouding your mind, sending indescribable pulses of warmth through your body.  And this plant woman is the source of it all.  But despite all that, and despite the fact she has explicitly told you her plan to keep the Knotties - and you - here forever, you don’t necessarily feel any malice in her words.  You get the exact opposite feeling.  There is a kindness to her, a nurturing quality to her voice that makes you think if you could just get her to understand, maybe she would let you go.

“N-no…” you murmur, trying to resist the sensations building up within you.  “This isn’t… not… we don’t…”

The plant woman frowns.  “Is something wrong?” she asks, leaning in close to look you in the eyes.

“We… we want to help, but…”

Her long vine tendrils continue to curl around you, sliding under your clothing, tugging the garments away.

“...but?” she asks sweetly.

You want to say more, but you can’t.  You can’t think straight, can’t form a coherent sentence.  Especially not when those vines tighten and pull you in closer, lifting you up so you’re sharing the interior of her flower with her.  Nectar sloshes around your legs, churning plant matter tugging downwards to pull you in deeper.  Something slips itself between your sex, making you moan in delight, and you feel her hands gently start to massage your heaving breasts.

“See?  Isn’t this nice?” she purrs.  “You’re a good girl.  So just enjoy it.  I’ll take care of everything.”

She leans in, stealing a kiss from your quivering lips, and any sense of composure you had left drains away.  All you can do is close your eyes and surrender yourself completely to her tender ministrations.

[[Give in-&gt;FC02LD]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="317" name="FC02LC" tags="" position="4725,800" size="100,100">It’s no use.  You were already heavily laden with her pollen when you approached.  Now that you’re so close that you can smell her honey-sweet nectar, you’ve lost all sense of composure.  All you can do is look down lamely as one of her vines snakes its way up your body, the tip of it unfurling into a brightly colored flower that sprays a puff of euphoric plant dust right into your face.

Your eyes roll back.  Your lips curl into a smile.  And every ounce of resistance fades from your body.  

“She’s right…” you drawl lazily, taking a step towards your wife.  “She can keep us… as long as she wants…”

“Melfy… no…” Revissa says, backing away weakly.  But that just takes right into Petal’s waiting arms.

The plant woman smiles, dripping some of her nectar into Revissa’s lips, and you watch as your wife finally succumbs as well.  Her shoulders droop, the tension leaves her body, and she smiles warmly towards you, and then to Petal.

“You want… to keep us… forever?” she murmurs, looking up at the beautiful woman above her.

“That’s right!” Petal says, stroking her hair.  “Now, why don’t the two of you get out of those silly clothes, and then we can begin?”

Neither of you can find any reason in the world to say no to her.

Now all you feel is warmth and pleasure, the indescribable joy of togetherness, the neverending susurrations of pleasure coursing through your unprotesting body.

At some point, Revissa joins you inside the flower bulb.  Had you been self-aware enough to think on it, that might have been a disappointment, since she was your hope for escaping.  Petal keeps the two of you half-submerged inside her plant, with vines digging inside your sexes to maintain a constant churn of stimulation as she takes turns kissing one of you, then the other, back and forth, hungrily and lustilly stoking your emotions to the breaking point.  There is no malice in her movements, not an ounce of wickedness or ill intent, her every action springing from a benevolent, albeit misguided sense of providing the two of you what you want.  She sensed that you came in peace, and so now she will ensure that you come peacefully, over and over, for the rest of your lives.  Escape is impossible, resistance unthinkable, but why would you want to do either?  You’ve never felt better in your life.

And so, slowly, the fronds of her massive flower fold themselves closed, and Petal’s body sinks into the soft soil, taking her two new friends with her as she spreads her roots throughout the forest to search for the place she is most needed.

Petal’s thoughts meld with your own, her memories bind themselves to your consciousness, as yours do to hers.  You can feel her in your mind, probing your thoughts, seeing everything from your life experience up to this point that has made you who you are today.  She doesn’t seem to find it particularly interesting.

Revissa, on the other hand, she understands.  Because your wife has lived a life of championing nature, of trying to protect the trees, the plants, and the animals of the galaxy, of fighting for freedom in the face of adversity.  You can sense the two of them growing closer, of their shared experiences mingling, reinforcing each other, bolstering their sense of togetherness.  But then… it hits a snag.

The memory that confuses Petal is a recent one.  Earlier this very day, the two of you had been trying to push towards the deepest part of the forest to plant the data device when Revissa had been led astray.  The forest had lured her into it, tried to capture her, meld with her, just like Petal is doing now.  But Revissa had fought back against it.  Both of you had.  You were painfully close to being completely overwhelmed, only escaping by the skin of your teeth.  What Petal doesn’t understand is *why* you would want to escape in the first place.  Isn’t being one with the forest your goal?

And so she delves deeper.  This time she actually gives your own memories a second glance, seeing how you’ve loved and laughed, fought and struggled.  She understands what it means to eat and drink, to make friends, to fly through space, to go on adventures, to overcome impossible odds, to see the galaxy, to fall asleep in the arms of your wife, to feel the thrill of victory and the shame of failure.  When you first approached her, you had sensed a lack of malice in Petal, and you were right.  The reason she trapped those Knotties in amber, why she drew you and Revissa into world was out of her own sense of benevolence - she was trying to give to you her own definition of happiness and fulfillment.  All she has ever known is this forest, and all she has ever desired was to see it thrive; the context of her life, the summation of her experiences was so different from yours that it led to a rather sizable misunderstanding, but now she knows more.  And because of it…

Suddenly, you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin.  You look up towards the blue sky, and an apologetic Petal looming over you.  You’re naked and covered in sap, your body exhausted from all the pleasure, but you’re free, and separate from her and from the forest.

“I’m sorry… I didn’t know…” she says, leaning forward with her arms pressed against her bosom.  Nectar still drips from her flower, and that pollen still swirls through the air, so your mind remains trapped in a daze.

Revissa seems a bit more composed.  “It’s alright… you were just doing what you thought was best for the forest.  I’d probably have done the same.”

Petal glances towards the women stuck in amber.  “So… do *they* want to be out too?”

“Probably,” Revissa admits.  “But I suggest you keep them there.  Otherwise they might go back to causing damage again.  I’m sure someone will come along to do something about them… eventually.”

*Way to be the big hero, Revissa*, you think to yourself.  But at least Petal is finally willing to let you go.  The three of you spend some more time chatting, explaining your mission and why you’re here.  And you end with a promise to help protect the forest, and the whole world from greedy opportunists trying to steal the planet’s bounty for themselves.  And Petal promises that she’ll talk to the other plants in the forest to make sure you have free reign to come and go as you please.  

In the end, she wishes you both goodbye, giving you each one last kiss that sends your mind reeling before you manage to pick up your discarded gear and get yourselves dressed.  And then she folds up her fronds and tunnels back into the soil, heading off to some other part of the forest that needs her.

What she suggests in this liminal space between interconnected minds is not something you ever would have accepted normally, but here, where consciousness mingles, it seems so patently obvious, that you can’t imagine having ever arrived at any other decision.

Your wife wants to protect nature, and you want to protect your wife.  And so, the two of you should stay here, in the forest, together, protecting it with your bodies and minds, hearts and souls.  And Petal has just the way to achieve that.  

Suddenly you are moving, bodies ferried through some kind of dimensional pocket that Petal uses to travel around the forest, a passage of pure life energy, a leyline of forest spirit.  And then you emerge, gasping for breath, shuddering with pleasure, and for a moment, you see a copse of trees, feel the warmth of sunlight, hear the rustling of branches and song of the birds.  You try to move, to reach towards those brilliant sensations, yet find that you cannot - but any anxiety that might have filled you with that realization vanishes as your body once again quakes with an intense orgasm.  Your eyes open wide, your lips curl back in ecstasy, and your voice pours forth for a few fleeting moments before it is silenced.  For a moment you realize that you are somehow pressed up against a tree - no, melded *with* a tree, half embedded in the bark of its trunk, before that rough wooden surface begins to swirl and flow, passing over you and transforming your body into just another part of nature.

And then it is over, and you and Revissa have reached the end of your journey.  You’re encased in bark, melded with a thick, powerful tree, bodies awash with pleasure, your lower lips parted as thick wooden tendrils jam themselves inside of you, keeping you hopelessly stimulated as your minds go blank with the sensations of joy and togetherness.  

Now you’re a literal part of the forest, your never-ending orgasms used as a spiritual food source to keep the land around you fresh, healthy, and well-nurtured.  This is the solution Petal came up with, the one you both accepted while your minds were linked.  If there was some part of you still capable of intelligent thought, you might have objected, but now there is only the endless pleasure, the intense churn of orgasmic bliss that comes from a job well done.

“I think… that Petal was some kind of… hub, I guess you could call it.  She connected with the plants in the nearby area, gave them an intelligence and willpower that they would have otherwise lacked.”

You nod your head, remembering how she was able to conjure up vines that seemed unrelated to her own main body.  Maybe now that she’s reached an understanding with you, you’ll have an easier time moving through the forest.

And as you link with it, your tree grows higher and mightier, its branches forming a vast canopy over the forest floor below.  It’s not something which requires conscious thought - which is a good thing, since you never stop thrumming with pleasure, even when your body no longer should have the physical capacity to experience it.

You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew.  Perhaps they searched for you after you lost contact, but could never find you – after all, they never would think to look for you embedded on the side of a tree.  Or perhaps they, too, fell prey to some peril of the planet, becoming trapped and forced to wait for a rescue from *you*.  Though that, of course, is a rescue that will never come.

But none of that really matters to you now, and to be honest, you barely spare your friends a single thought.  There’s just no room in your mind for it amidst all the euphoric eruptions of pleasure.

And so, as the days become years, and the years stretch to eternity, you remain here, your tree healthy and strong, the forest safe, and with your wife frozen in wood grain at your side.  You couldn’t be happier with the outcome.

Your body is shrouded in bark, transformed into a relief embedded in the side of a mighty tree.

It’s not something which requires conscious thought - which is a good thing, since you never stop thrumming with pleasure, even when your body no longer should have the physical capacity to experience it.

And you might have stayed that way forever, if not for the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of your adventure.  Your friends would never have been able to find you otherwise, nor would they have recognized what you have now become.  It’s several days after you were first transformed that they manage to locate you, and several weeks beyond that before Vhaja and Jyumon are able to work out the specifics of the unusual transformation, and devise the sigils for a recovery spell that Lumina manages to properly incant.  But even after you and Revissa are freed from your barky prisons and returned to the ship, it will take months of recovery time and mental reconditioning to fully separate your minds from the endless pleasure of the forest.

It won’t be until a year later that you are finally ready to go adventuring again - though obviously, you’ve failed this particular mission.  And from then on, you and Revissa both will always find yourselves getting rather hot and bothered whenever you look at a particularly sturdy tree.

Though you might have worked up the willpower to resist her control for the moment, any minute that might change.  Maybe in a protracted fight you’d be able to wear Petal down with your sword, but when the clock is ticking you know that you’re going to need Revissa to use her magic to turn the tides in your favor.

And so, you make the executive decision to run towards your lovely wife and try to cut her bonds.  It’s a good plan – but it doesn’t work.

Because as it turns out, you underestimated Petal, and the extent of her control over this forest and the soil it rests on.  You thought if you just kept an eye on the vines extending from her main body, you’d be safe, that she had a range limit for how far they could twist through the earth beneath you.  But you were wrong.  With a twitch of her hand, she summons a totally unrelated plant to spring forth from the ground at your feet, commanding it to snare you with even more leafy ropes.

In an instant, the tendrils are around you, snatching your sword and throwing it uselessly to the side.  More catch your legs, holding you in place, as a thick plant membrane starts to spread up from the ground, adhering itself tightly against your legs.  As it closes around you, the air fills with the cloying scent of pollen, sapping your willpower as the vines begin shearing away your clothes.  As you look down in surprise, another vine twists upwards and catches both your wrists, binding your arms behind your back as the membrane creeps higher and higher, threatening to engulf you completely.

Maybe, in an ideal situation, you’d still have been strong enough to fight them off.  But you’re already so damned horny.  And so, when one of those naughty tentacles slips itself between the gap in your legs, plunging deep into your sex, you yelp in surprise and arousal, losing the fight to keep the vines from tugging you down completely into the plant’s ravenous maw.

The last thing you see before the membrane snaps closed over the top of your head is Petal’s smiling face, and Revissa&#39;s body being encircled by her own hungry plant.  And then there’s only darkness as you are fully consumed.  For a moment you writhe there, helpless and horny, unable to resist as the plant’s tendrils probe inside your lower lips with lusty abandon.  But then you are pushed over the edge, and together with your rumbling climax you feel the vines holding you begin to move, burrowing deep underground and taking your captive body with them.

Based on your observations, it looks like Petal is both the gorgeous woman and the flower her body is extending out of.  And though it pains you to hurt her, you think that if you manage to cut the stem out from beneath the flower, you may be able to sever her connection to the earth and ground.  Considering how quickly she caught Revissa with subterranean vines, you know that in an extended fight, she’ll just catch you too.  So the best time to act is now, when she might not realize the threat that you pose to her.

So you charge towards her, taking a zig-zag pattern to hopefully confound any attempts to snare you with more leafy tendrils.  And sure enough, several do spring up from the ground as you run, trying to snag your arms or legs but coming up with only air as you deftly dodge away from their grip.  Yes - this can work!  You manage to close the distance between the two of you, doing your best not to look Petal in the eyes, since you’re sure the expression she makes when her flower is sliced will hurt you as much as it hurts her.  And then with a deep breath and a steeling battle cry you swing your blade with all the force you can muster, striking the stem of her flower strong and true.

*Thunk.*

Your blade finds home, embedding itself into the sturdy stem of plant flesh, doing a bit of damage… but not nearly enough to cleave itself all the way through.

“Owwww!” screeches Petal, voice filled with pain and regret.  “Why… *why* would you do that?!

Realizing you’re going to need another swing to finish severing the stem, you try to pull your sword away, but find that it is firmly stuck.  You get two solid tugs at it before you’re given no more, and powerful loops of vines wrap around your body and pull you away.

“You people… all you people are *just the worst*!” Petal yells, tears forming in her eyes.  “First you come and cut down trees and hurt the animals… and now this?  I thought if I was nice and gave them a home here, they would stop causing so much trouble, but I guess you’re never going to stop, are you?”

You try to pull free, but she’s angry now, and her vines prove to be much stronger than you are.  They wrap around you, pull away your clothing, extract your sword from her stem and toss it away into the woods, never to be seen again.

“How many more of you annoying… *pests* are there?” she asks.

“I… I don’t…” you start to say, but she’s having none of it.

“Tell me!” she demands, twisting you upside down then dunking your face into the nectar pooling up around her thighs.  And then she pulls you in close, cupping your face and bringing it in for a sap-filled kiss.  “Tell me,” she says again, softer, cloyingly.

The nectar is so sweet, so wonderful, it washes away any fear or doubts.  Of course you’ll tell her.  After all… she asked you so nicely.  And it’s only fair after what you’ve done to her.

“We came… on a starship.  There were… six of us.  You already have… me and Revissa…”

“And the others?” Petal asks.  “Can you call them?  Bring them here?”

You nod, glancing towards your comm device which was pulled from your arm when she stripped you.  A vine snatches it up and brings it close to your face.

“Then call them.  Get them all in one place.  And then we’ll end this infestation once and for all!”

Though it’s obviously meant to contain humanoids, there’s no reason that it shouldn’t work on plants - especially a plant as shapely as this one.  If you could aim it properly, it shouldn’t be too hard to cause the gas to erupt and encase Petal in quickly hardening metal, eliminating her as a threat for the time being.

But there’s the problem - if you miss, you’re in deep trouble, because you doubt she’ll give you a second chance.  Which means that the important thing is to wait for an opening.  Petal continues to smile at you in that enchanting way of hers, beckoning you to come closer.  She’s not making any aggressive moves at the moment, but she’s not going to wait forever, so you’d better pick something quickly.

Time loses all meaning here, the hours passing by in a warm haze as all thoughts and emotions give way to nothing but the sensation of absolute pleasure.  Previously, you might have tried to fight against it, but now you know that this is where you belong, this is what you want.

If there is one downside to your new arrangement, it’s that Revissa is not here with you.  And yet, you can somehow still sense her.  The roots of the plant that encases you spread far and wide, connecting with a network of organisms that encompass the entire forest - no, more than that, this whole world.  And through that connection, you know that Revissa is still nearby, locked in the same cycle of pleasure, helpless to resist but so overwhelmed with sensation that she would never want to.  So in the end, it’s not so bad.  After a while, you stop feeling lonely, learning how to let go of your ego and accept the fact that now you are just another part of the ecosystem.

With everything here made of Ghost Matter, you never grow hungry, never want for nourishment or fear the ravages of time.  In here, buried in the soil, you are eternal.  Nothing ever comes for you, no one ever tries to dig you up.  Vaguely you recall a life on a starship, a crew full of friends, but if they are still on the planet, you don’t ever see them.  Maybe they left.  Or maybe some other peril on the planet took them.  You don’t know, nor does it seem all that important to you now.

What does matter is keeping yourself stimulated, since your pleasure serves as some kind of psychic nutrient that feeds and sustains the forest around you.  Luckily, that won’t be a problem.  Though every day from now on will be exactly the same, at the same time, it will also always be a climax.

At least, that’s how it started.  But after an indeterminate amount of time, that awareness of your wife is suddenly cut away.  How?  Why?  Who would do this, who would take you away from each other?  The loneliness and indignation might have consumed you, had you not also been pulled away only minutes later.

As it turns out, your crew was able to track you down thanks to the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of the adventure.  And though it took several months for them to return to the planet with the excavation equipment needed to dig you out from the soil, when they did, they found that you and Revissa were enclosed in flowers side by side, a few scant feet apart from one another.  She was extracted first, but you came soon after, and once you were secured they quickly dragged you to your ship and flew away.

What will follow is several long months of recovery as you learn how to exist as a single entity and not a part of the forest, but eventually you’ll be back on your feet again and ready to go on more adventures.  Though hopefully, they will go better than this one, which was rather decisively a complete failure.

“Well then where the hell is she?” Krysta grumbles, looking around.  “After dragging us all the way out here, the least she could do is wait somewhere that we can see her.”

“I swear… if I came all this way and got covered in sweat for nothing…” says Jyumon, happy to bring up the rear in the search party.

Lumina unfurls her wings.  “Do you think she might be hurt?  She sounded strange in the message she left us.”  With a flap, she takes to the air… and then she spies you, sitting naked in the middle of an open field, cross-legged, with a placid smile on your face.

“This way…” you say lazily, mind still trapped in a daze.  By now your nose has grown accustomed to the scent of pollen, but it’s still here, flowing in the air, turning your mind to mush and binding your willpower to the flower-woman that produced it.

Though Petal, sadly, is nowhere to be found.  She had no desire to come into close contact with any more ‘parasites,’ as she now refers to you and any other humanoid that intrudes in her forest.  But the trap she’s set should be more than enough to handle your crew.

“Melfy?  Are you… okay?”  Lumina flutters down, putting a hand onto your forehead with a frown.  “You’ve got a fever.  What happened?  And where is Revissa?”

Your wife, you are well aware, is strung up in a nearby tree, mummified in vines and writhing helplessly as she is subjected to orgasm after orgasm.  You can’t wait to rejoin her.  But first you need to make sure the pests are taken care of.  And yet… some part of you still knows that is wrong.

“I… we… you need… to… get away…” you manage to murmur.  “It’s… a… a…”

But then you trail off, unable to effectively communicate your warning.  Lumina catches on to the situation though, raising her staff as it thrums with celestial energy.  

“Your mind is clouded,” she says with a frown.  “Hold on…”

The spell washes over you and has the intended effect.  All at once the grip of the pollen lessens, allowing you to open your eyes wide and jump to your feet.

“Everyone, get out of here!” you yell.  “It’s a trap!”

Jyumon sighs.  “I figured as much,” she says, her bushy tail flicking as her hands finish tracing the somatic motions for a fireball spell in the air.  “Which is why I came prepared with my favorite gardening tool.  No way I’m going to — accckkkmmmmpphhh!”

Despite her confidence, she hadn’t expected the vines to spring up so quickly.  In an instant her clothes are shredded, her limbs restrained, and her lips sealed, preventing her from finishing the spell she had so sagely prepared.  With a tug she is pulled to the ground, bound, gagged, and helpless.  But she’s about to have company.

“They’re coming from the ground!” Vhaja yells, quickly swishing her fingers to imbue herself with a spell of levitation.  Her feet shoot up from the ground, body bobbing in the air maybe five feet from the forest floor.  Lumina gets the message and makes herself airborne as well, the two of them preparing magic that will help them overcome the trials facing them.  But the vines aren’t limited to terrestrial targets.  They emerge from the soil and spring up much farther than the pair could have predicted, swiftly wrapping round their bodies and divesting them of their clothing.

It’s at this point that the culprit of the assault makes itself known.   A massive, brilliantly colored flower emerges from the soil at your feet, its leaves spreading outwards to reveal even more of the dextrous tendrils it had used to snare its prey.  You’re caught immediately, tight green ropes wrapping around your already naked form, though Krysta tries to make an acrobatic leap backwards to avoid capture.  It doesn’t work.  The plant manages to catch her by the wrists, binding her arms together and dragging her to the forest floor, swiftly shredding her clothing and pulling her backwards towards its waiting maw.  She tries to claw the earth with her bare feet to slow it down, but it makes a negligible difference as your crew is all brought into its fold.]

For a few seconds, you put up a token resistance, trying to pull the powerful vines away from your body, but a fragrant puff of pollen from the plant’s center quickly undoes whatever benefit Lumina’s healing spell had given you.  Your arms go slack as your mind drifts off, the vines tightening ever more firmly to make sure you’re unable to resist.  Jyumon’s restrained body is soon dragged over to join you, as well as Revissa, who was bundled up tightly in the trees out of sight.  

You look helplessly between the squirming bodies of your crew, hoping at least one of them will find some way to escape the plant’s grip before it’s too late, but alas, the opportunity for salvation is painfully fleeting, gone within a few minutes.  Because as more and more of that pollen spills out, your friends’ struggles grow weaker and weaker, until not a single one of you is spared the drugged stupor of compliance that these nefarious plants can wreak.  

Petal had called you and your friends parasites, said you were invasive pests.  Whether she was justified with that insult is up for debate, but what is not in question is the fact that she knew just the pesticide to take care of you.  Because soon all six of you are fully consumed by pleasure, bound up in vines that don’t leave even an ounce of mobility.  And once it is sure you’re all properly packaged, the plant pulls your bodies in close, smushing warm flesh against each other so you all become a single writhing, moaning, orgasming mass of churning bodies.  Dextrous vines snake themselves between slick thighs, pressing themselves into awaiting sexes to bring you all into a simultaneous climax that seems to stretch on for hours.

And then, finally, the flower’s petals close in over the six of you, shielding you from the light, forming a snug cocoon over your impotently squirming figures.  Its roots extend downwards, dragging itself, and the six of you, deep underground, where the tantric waves of euphoria you all release will serve as spiritual fertilizer for the forest for many generations to come.

A Scout was checking out the fruits of the forest to use in some new candy R&amp;D and happened to pick up on a distress signal emanating from underneath her feet.  After some complicated excavation, she managed to dig you all up and free you from the confines of the lust-inducing plant.  

Of course, it’s been so long that the galaxy has changed immensely since you were all first caught, meaning everyone is going to have to start new lives in a world mostly unfamiliar to you.  It’s the start of a brand new adventure… though you’re only beginning it because you failed at your old one.

There’s no way you’d be stupid enough to get closer - her pollen would sap away your resolve immediately!  Instead, you’re just going to have to take the risk of tossing the canister from here.

“Is something wrong?” Petal says sweetly.  Beside her, the vines wrapped around Revissa tighten, causing your wife to mewl helplessly with pleasure.  

Well, it’s now or never.  Gripping the canister firmly, you wind your arm back and then toss it with all your might, sending the grenade-like projectile careening towards the curvaceous plant woman.  But then your heart skips a beat as you watch it veer off its path.  Being an oddly shaped object, it does not move in exactly the direction you thought it was going to, spinning at a weird angle that will take it past her shoulders instead of right at her feet.  However, luck is on your side, as instead of letting it sail past her, Petal snaps a vine into the air, catching the canister with enough force to cause it to shatter into pieces right above her, sending a misty wave of vapor right down onto her body.

She shrieks in surprise, and you can see her start to stiffen, freezium gas clinging to her frame and swiftly calcifying into a metal shell.  But… it’s not quite enough.  Normally freezium is dispersed in a small chamber to make sure the gas circulates evenly, so that several layers of icy molecules cling to the subject and trap them in an impermeable shell.  But when it’s airborne like this, there’s a lot of waste product that doesn’t attach itself to her, especially when she’s flailing and struggling to break free.  You can hear the metal snapping and crackling –meaning she’ll only be trapped for a few seconds at most.  

Sadly, the battle is far from over, so you’ll have to come up with something else if you want to emerge victorious.

One step, and then another, you advance slowly but with determination, not breaking eye contact with the woman for even a moment.  You tell yourself it’s because you want to read her expression in case she decides to attack, but honestly, it’s because she’s just so damn beautiful.  The curl of her lips, the fluffiness of her leafy hair, the swell of her bosom, and, yes, that amazing smell.  You can’t help but take a deep whiff of the pollen as you draw near, feeling its warmth spread through you.  It’s such a calming scent, making your worries melt away as you finally arrive at the foot of her bulbous plant.

“What’s that in your hand?” she asks sweetly, tilting her head to examine the canister.

“Oh… this?” you murmur.

…wait, what was it again?  Oh, right.  You were supposed to throw it!  But… why would you want to throw it?  It’s hard to remember with your mind in such a dreamy fog.

“It’s… erm.  It’s called… freezium.  It… freezes things,” you explain.

“Freezes?” Petal says with a frown.  “I don’t much like the cold.”

“Right, sorry,” you say, stowing the canister back in your pack.  You wouldn’t want to upset Petal.  She’s just so lovely!  Though, distantly, your mind warns you about something.  Wasn’t… wasn’t this freezium important for some reason?  You were… right, you were supposed to throw it at someone!  But… who?  Petal says she doesn’t like the cold.  So it couldn’t have been for her.

“What were you going to freeze?” she asks, as one of her vines curls around your shoulder.  You see the tip of it is slick with that amber nectar of hers, its scent even more divine than the pollen.

“I… erm… I can’t…”  It’s so hard to think!  You were going to use this canister on someone… because someone needed to be frozen.  But… if it wasn’t Petal… then the only other person it could possibly be for is… yourself?  “It’s… for me?”

“For you?” Petal asks warmly.  “But surely not just you.  For her, too, right?”

She glances down at Revissa, still restrained by her vines.  Yes, that makes sense, you think.  The two of you were going to be frozen.  That’s the only explanation that makes sense.  Vaguely you feel some alarm bells going off in the back of your head about an alternative reason, but you quickly push them down.  And meanwhile, Petal helpfully uses her tendrils to peel away your clothing, leaving you naked and in a compliant daze in front of her.

“Well?  Go ahead, get frozen,” she says with a welcoming smile.

Completely under her spell, you just nod.  “It’s… better to do it with the machine…” you murmur, taking Revissa by the hand.  Petal releases her from the grip of the plants, allowing her to go with you.  “But… I’ll see if we can’t have a drone deliver us to you when you’re finished…”

Petal claps her hands.  “That sounds lovely!” she says, using a vine to push the two of you in the direction of the freezing chamber.

What happens next is a blur.  You walk and open a door.  You press some buttons and hear a whoosh.  You input some commands to some droids, then you step into a small, cramped chamber together with Revissa.  The two of you wrap your arms around each other and then relax, as you hear the rush of air and feel an intense cold on your skin.  And then… you feel and see nothing at all.

A few minutes later, Petal looks up as some security drones arrive, using hover-beams to slide a thick slab of metal down in front of her.

“Wow… so that’s what it’s like to be frozen,” she says, feeling the contours of the metal casing with her vines.  “It’s not for me… but it’s a good look for you two!”

You and Revissa, of course, have no response.  And you won’t have one for a long, long time.  Petal spends some time appreciating you, as well as Ros’eela and the other Knottie, which the same droids were kind enough to carry over to her as well.  But in the end, she has places to go and forests to protect, so she leaves you there on the ground, a curious novelty that is soon forgotten entirely.  And then all there is left to do is wait.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="334" name="FC02MD" tags="" position="5275,1125" size="100,100">A thought occurs to you.  Throwing the freezium from far away risks missing, but getting too close puts you in range of her pollen.  But what if there was a way to incapacitate her for a short while that had a higher chance of success?

In addition to the canister of freezium, you also have a perfectly sealed sphere of alien goop, which you are sure will break out of its shell at the slightest impact.  And if that impact were to occur next to a certain sultry plant woman, well, then that would make her be most likely target for its slimy assault.  

You flash what you hope is a disarming smile towards Petal as you fish through your pack for the frozen slim.  

“Wow… you’re so pretty,” you say, as your fingers clasp around the sphere.  “I really wanna get to know you better.  Do you mind if we play a game?”

“A game?” Petal says, with equal parts interest and caution.  She can clearly tell that you’re not fully under her spell just yet, but at the same time, she seems intensely curious about you.  “What kind of game?”

“Oh, it’s a very simple thing.  Children play it all the time.”  You palm the frozen orb and shift your posture to a pitcher’s stance.  “It’s called… *catch!*”

And then the ball flies from your hand.  Petal moves quickly - more quickly than you had expected - shifting the positioning of her vines to intercept the projectile before it strikes her.  But that only shatters the frozen coating around the rubbery symbiote and frees it from its icy slumber, immediately causing it to awaken and wrap itself around her body.

“W-what is this?!” she shrieks.  “I don’t think I like this game — hrmmph!”

You watch as it attaches itself to her face, forming a rubbery sheathe over her lips, and completely occupying her attention.  Now’s the time to strike!

Running forward, you pull out the freezium canister, getting close enough that you’re sure it won’t miss.  And with a toss, it falls and shatters at the base of her giant flower, forming a cloud of metallic mist that envelops her from top to bottom.  The gooey symbiote reacts immediately, pulling itself away from Petal’s body as it is once more subjected to sub-zero temperatures, but with its structural integrity already compromised from the previous freezing it instead completely flakes apart into nothing.  This just leaves Petal, who swivels her hips to look towards you, a feeling of betrayal evident in her eyes, before the mist fully hardens around her.

And then she’s a statue.  The leaves covering her generous bosom harden and crack away, and all that fragrant nectar pooled up in her lap dissolves.  No more enchanting pollen spreads from her leaves, and no more vines curl up from the ground to protect her.  She’s been completely defeated.

You fall to the ground in relief, finally able to think clearly.  And beside you, you see the tendrils that had been binding up Revissa go slack, letting her pull herself free and slump down at your side.

For a while, you both just lay there, but eventually you wrap your arms around each other and work off the arousal that had been building up since you first set eyes on the gorgeous plant woman.  When you’re finished, you put your clothes back on and return to the outpost, leaving the inert plant sculpture behind.

And so you decide to take the initiative and rush towards her, sword drawn.  The freezium metal will only be keeping her in check for a few moments, but you’ve turned the tides of a battle in less time than that.  

Based on your observations, it looks like Petal is both the gorgeous woman and the flower her body is extending out of.  And though it pains you to hurt her, you think that if you manage to cut the stem out from beneath the flower, you may be able to sever her connection to the earth and ground.  Considering how quickly she caught Revissa with subterranean vines, you know that in an extended fight, she’ll just catch you too.  So the best time to act is now, while she’s still incapacitated.  With a deep breath and a steeling battle cry you swing your blade with all the force you can muster, striking the stem of her flower strong and true.

*Thunk.*

Your blade finds home, embedding itself into the sturdy stem of plant flesh, doing a bit of damage… but not nearly enough to cleave itself all the way through.  It was foolish to think that you could defeat her with a single blow.  And even worse, the ringing impact from your sword strike seems to have accelerated the process of her cracking out of the freezium shell.  You see it flake off, bits of metal dropping to the ground, revealing the gorgeous woman beneath it … as well as the snarl of rage on her face over the wound you had inflicted on her.

“Owwww!” screeches Petal, voice filled with pain and regret.  “Why… *why* would you do that?!

Realizing you’re going to need another swing to finish severing the stem, you try to pull your sword away, but find that it is firmly stuck.  You get two solid tugs at it before you’re given no more, and powerful loops of vines wrap around your body and pull you away.

“You people… all you people are *just the worst*!” Petal yells, tears forming in her eyes.  “First they come and cut down trees and hurt the animals… and now this?  I thought if I was nice and gave them a home here, they would stop causing so much trouble, but I guess you’re *neve*r going to stop, are you?”

You try to pull free, but she’s angry now, and her vines prove to be much stronger than you are.  They wrap around you, pull away your clothing, extract your sword from her stem and toss it away into the woods, never to be seen again.

“How many more of you annoying… *pests* are there?” she demands.

“I… I don’t…” you start to say, but she’s having none of it.

“Tell me!” she demands, twisting you upside down then dunking your face into the nectar pooling up around her thighs.  And then she pulls you in close, cupping your face and bringing it in for a sap-filled kiss.  “Tell me,” she says again, softer, cloyingly.

The nectar is so sweet, so wonderful, it washes away any fear or doubts.  Of course you’ll tell her.  After all… she asked you so nicely.  And it’s only fair after what you’ve done to her.

“We came… on a starship.  There were… six of us.  You already have… me and Revissa…”

“And the others?” Petal asks.  “Can you call them?  Bring them here?”

You nod, glancing towards your comm device which was pulled from your arm when she stripped you.  A vine snatches it up and brings it close to your face.

“Then call them.  Get them all in one place.  And then we’ll end this infestation once and for all!”

The freezium bought you a chance to prove discretion is the better part of valor, and you’d be a fool not to take it.  So instead of rushing at the plant woman, you instead attack the vines she had used to snare your wife, severing the leafy tendrils with a few well-placed sword slashes.  Once Revissa is free, you quickly take her by the hand and pull her away, fleeing the clearing where the beguiling plant woman has made her home.

Though as you leave, you can’t help but remember Ros’eela.  You’d left her mounted on the wall of one of the buildings in the living quarters.  The right thing to do would be to go back and thaw her out… though the more time you waste here, the more opportunity Petal will have to catch you.

As you walk, Revissa closes her eyes for a moment, sensing some kind of change in the texture of the forest around you.

“I think… that Petal was some kind of… hub, I guess you could call it.  She connected with the plants in the nearby area, gave them an intelligence and willpower that they would have otherwise lacked.”

You nod your head, remembering how she was able to conjure up vines that seemed unrelated to her own main body.  Maybe now that she’s been rendered inert, you’ll have an easier time moving through the forest.  Though before that, you have something else you need to do.  Heading back to the buildings of the living quarters, you locate the room with the freezium chamber, finding Ros’eela and the other Knottie right where you left them, mounted on the wall.  Enough time passed during the encounter with Petal that it should be safe to thaw Ros’eela out from her metal prison, should you so desire.

Though… it’s not like you *have* to unfreeze her just yet.  If you do, she would probably report what happened to the main encampment, which would take away a potential trump card that could be used in future negotiations.  Maybe you could keep her on ice at least until you’re done with what you need to do on the planet.  Surely she’d understand; freezium is a part of Knottie culture after all, though to a lesser degree than bondage.  Besides… she’d look rather fetching on the wall of your quarters…

Ros’eela expresses her thanks, and promises to help you out however she can in the future, should you need it.

You’d like to tell yourself that if you didn’t trust her already, you’d have been able to fight her off.  But… that’s probably not accurate.  Her mastery of bondage martial arts is unparalleled, and before you know you and your wife have been trussed up in ropes and placed entirely at her mercy.  She has the gall to call it a ‘simple tie’, as she rigs up some kind of pulley system to suspend the two of you from the ceiling, looking you over with satisfaction as you wriggle and squirm against the taut restraints.  Simple or not, you’re pretty sure you wouldn’t be able to escape at all, even if you had days to work at it.

Luckily, Ros’eela only wants you for an hour or two.  She puts those head tendrils of hers to good work, pressing her face between your writhing bodies and inserting the tips of them past the crotch ropes and into the slits between your legs, massaging you both to a warm and wet orgasm while you moan into your gags.  Then she ties *herself* up, forcing herself into a kneeling position and locking those tendrils in place, squirming together with the two of you as she pushes you over the edge for round two.

Unlike you, she has no problem escaping from the binds she applied, so after she’s had her fun she unties herself then unhooks you from the ceiling, instead flopping you down onto the bed (thankfully without triggering the vacuum sealing feature on it). Then she ties herself up again and nuzzles in between you, letting you all take a refreshing bondage nap together.  After an hour she finally decides she is done repaying you, undoing your bonds and allowing you to take a quick shower and get dressed.  Despite the unusual nature of the rest, you have to admit it does leave you feeling recharged.  She gives you each one final affectionate kiss before sending you on your way back into the forest, opting to stay behind to finish up the work that needs doing at the outpost.

So with all of that taken care of, you feel you are now ready to continue on with your original mission.  Revissa was pretty confident that there would be no more threats from the local flora, meaning it should be a straight shot to the deepest part of the forest where you need to set up the data collection device.  Though of course it’s always possible Revissa made a mistake.  If you’re not feeling confident about your chances, you could always double back and try a different route through the forest.

“It would just be until we leave the planet,” you promise.

You quickly explain the situation with Petal, letting her know the danger you’re all in by sticking around here.  But despite your worries, Ros’eela decides that the right thing to do would be to return to the cargo ship and keep trying to get in touch with the main camp.

“I… can feel it,” she says.  “A malice, an urgency in everything around us.  She doesn’t want to let us go, and this whole area of forest is willing to help her stop us.”

That’s not good at all.  Her prediction immediately comes true as a thick tree root suddenly bursts out of the ground to try and trip you up, followed by a heavy branch swinging across the path in front of you.  But you’re fast enough to push past them, emerging back at the riverbank where you first spotted the tree with the faucet on it.  That same tree starts to erupt, spilling glossy sap on the forest floor, forcing you to dodge to the side lest you get coated in quick-drying amber.

Eventually, you reach the point where you need to branch off from the river, and to your relief, the only thing in your way is a large, open, grassy patch of land, no trees, flowers, or bushes in sight - there’s not even any large rocks or other obstructions for a predator to hide behind.  In such a wide, clear area, you feel like there’s no chance of getting taken by surprise.  Though as you walk over it, Revissa pauses for a moment, frowning, before she kneels down and brushes her fingers through the blades of grass.

“The grass… does not appreciate being walked on,” she says slowly.  “It’s quite angry with us.”

You raise an eyebrow.  Trees and flowers, sure, you can see them having some degree of emotions, but *grass*?  Though you can tell Revissa is serious.  So with a sigh, you abandon the safety of the wide-open field and double back to the treeline, keeping to the rough, root-strewn patches of soil beneath the shade of the branches.  You feel rather silly about it, but luckily there’s nothing lurking in the shadows of the overhead boughs, and so you eventually advance to the center of the forest with only a slight delay thanks to the detour.

Revissa listens as you express your fears, and eventually agrees to double back with you.  “If I had to guess, it’s the proximity to the river that has made the plants in this particular stretch so exceedingly active” she muses, sparing a glance towards the water as you make your retreat.  “So the farther away from it we get, the less likely we’ll meet anyone else like Petal.”

Even here in the water, you can see various plants bordering the river trying to turn against you, springing up from the riverbed or springing downwards from overhanging branches.  But you manage to evade them, in no small part thanks to Revissa’s nature magic, keeping the aggressive flora at bay until you have put considerable distance between yourselves and the Knottie outpost.  Eventually you feel you have gone far enough and pull yourselves out of the water, finding on your map that you’re a short distance away from where you started.

“Hmm…” Revissa says, closing her eyes and feeling the pulse of nature around her.  “I think Petal’s range is limited.  We’ve gone far enough away from her that I don’t think we’ll be in any more danger from her influence.”

Well, that’s a relief.  Though it also means that, for all your efforts, you’re right back at square one.  It looks like you’ve got no choice but to find another path through the forest if you want to complete your mission.

But you fight through them.  Between your swordplay and Revissa’s nature magic, they aren’t able to hold you down, and eventually you feel that you’ve gotten far enough away that you’re in the clear.  Revissa warns you to still be wary, of course, but for now you stop running and slow your pace, finally allowing yourself to breathe normally again.

If you had looked that way, you might have noticed the ominous way the blades of grass shifted as you walked over them, swaying not in sync with the direction of the wind but their own internal chemistry.  How every strand bent towards the intruders in their territory, how the two of you were not welcome, even here, in an open, unassuming stretch of land.

The grass waits until the two of you are far into the center of the patch of green, when you stop for a moment to pull off your boot to shake out a pebble that had gotten stuck.  It is the very moment that the rock strikes the ground that the grass begins to sway, suddenly growing in length and spooling outwards with a mind all its own.  In an instant your legs have been wrenched together, throwing you off balance and making you drop your boot onto the ground.  More blades of grass twirl upwards to ensnare and destroy the foreign object, turning it into tiny scraps that are swiftly buried beneath the soil.  As if the grass wants to cover up any trace of your existence.

Beside you, Revissa shrieks in surprise as she, too, is targeted, her staff yanked from her hand and dropped with a soft thunk onto the soft green surface beneath her.  Your instinct is to reach out towards her, but the growing coils of flora capture your arm and pull it against your body, shredding any clothing it catches along the way.  Now realizing the peril the two of you are in, your wife tries to close her eyes and use her magic to connect with the grass attempting to entrap you, but all she senses is a terrifying, violent impulse to subjugate all that does not belong.  She comes out of her trance with a gasp, just as the grass curls past her chin and over her mouth to seal away her voice.

With only a moment before you, too, are fully restrained, you recall the freezium gas capsule you had liberated from the chamber back at the outpost.  You manage to pull it out of your bag at the last possible moment with your one free arm, just as the grass snags your wrist.  The capsule drops to the ground, but you manage to catch the edge of it with your teeth and yank open the release valve, causing super-chilled metallic gas to spray outwards all around you.  Propelled by the expelled vapor, the capsule shoots around randomly, icing over the thin fibers of grass and causing it to shatter away, but never expelling enough over you or Revissa’s body to fully encase you.  This gives you the opportunity you need to escape the grip of the plants, scooping up your wife and making a run for the trees as flakes of hardened metal crackle away from your body.

The grass is not done trying to catch you, but now that you’re expecting it you manage to wrench it off of your ankles before it wraps you up, and then with one final leap you dive beneath the cover of the trees, outside of the range  the probing tendrils can reach.  You and Revissa lay there panting for a good while, looking fearfully towards what had seemed to just be an unassuming patch of greenery.

“I think… this particular field of grass very much does not like to be stepped on,” Revissa murmurs after a moment. 

“Maybe ask it to put up a ‘keep off the grass sign’ next time?” you suggest, getting just a roll of her eyes in response.

Your clothing and weapons were all destroyed by the attack, but luckily you managed to hold on to your satchel containing the data device for the mission, as well as the synthesizer capsules Jyumon provided you to create duplicates of your outfits.  So after a few minutes the two of you are dressed up again and ready to continue towards the heart of the forest – though this time you make sure to avoid any patches of grass along the way.

Let it be somebody else’s problem, you figure.]

Once you get far enough away from the camp, the cloying scent of sweet pollen finally fades away, allowing you to think clearly once again.  It was starting to get hard to concentrate.  Regardless, you double back to the edge of the path leading to the outpost, finding yourself once more at the side of the river.  And now you turn back the way you came, returning to the entrance of the forest to hopefully find a safer path to the heart of the woods.

Unfortunately, it turns out that in the end, nothing in this part of the forest is truly safe.  For no sooner do you let your mind wander and glance towards the readout on your holo-map than you feel the rumble of movement from beneath the soil, followed by the eruption of several hidden creeper vines that dart upwards and wrap themselves around your limbs.

[[Get tangled-&gt;FC04D]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="348" name="FC04D" tags="" position="2100,175" size="100,100">You grunt in surprise as the vines wrap around your legs, pulling themselves taut to anchor you to the spot.

“Grah!  I’ve had enough of these damn plants!” you yell, trying to reach for your sword.  But they seem to have predicted that, as several more green tendrils emerge from a tree branch above you, snagging your wrist before you can get a grip on the weapon.

“It’s like… they don’t want to let us leave,” Revissa says nervously, clutching her staff firmly as she tries to connect with the natural world around you.  “They… they see us as a source of nourishment.  They want our life energy to… to fertilize the forest!”

“Well tell them my energy is reserved for other things!” you yell, tugging at the vine that caught your arm.  But no sooner do you sever it than another one springs up to catch it again.  And then the ones at your legs creep higher, climbing up your body and beneath your clothes, bursting outwards to shred your outfit into tattered scraps.

Revissa begins to panic as she gets targeted as well.  Leafy tendrils snare her legs, pressing them together firmly.  

“Maybe if I… use a Plant Growth spell I can convince them we’re more useful to them active than tied up,” she reasons, working on an incantation for just that.  But even after the nature energy spools outwards from her staff and into the ground beneath you, the vines don’t stop probing.  In fact, they just climb higher, binding Revissa’s arms to her sides and ruining her clothing as well.

Seeing it didn’t help, you redouble your efforts against the vines, but they are ruthlessly persistent, growing tighter and stronger with every passing second.  You only manage to free your arm for a moment before it’s snatched up once again.  And now you’re somehow feeling a strange tingling sensation down towards your legs.

“What… why is it… my legs feel… weak,” you murmur, glancing downwards.  And then your eyes widen in fear as you see a brown, barky texture beginning to spread along your skin.  “Revissa!  It’s… transforming me…”

She notices it on you as well, and a look of regret flashes across her face.

“No… I… my spell only empowered them.  Unlocked… new abilities.  They were just trying to catch us before… but now… they are trying to… to convert us into a part of the forest!”

You give one last tug against the restraints, but your strength is waning.  “Can you… do something else?”

“I… I didn’t want to hurt them… but maybe… a withering spell will — mmphh!”

But her words are cut off as more vines snake around her lips.  Did the plants *know* she was planning on harming them?  You try to call out to give her encouragement, but feel the same tendrils snaking around your mouth as well.  This is bad, really bad.  You don’t have the energy to keep resisting.  And your body is growing more and more numb as the transformation creeps higher.  Up your legs, over your hips, around your breasts, down your arms to the tips of your fingers.  Your limbs lock in place, sensation flees your body, the sound of crackling bark fills your ears as it reaches your neck.

“Mmmpphh…”

You can only make one last plaintive grunt of helplessness towards Revissa, sparing her a pleading glance before wood grain washes over your face and everything goes black.  She only lasts a few minutes longer than you do before she suffers the same fate, converted into a wooden statue that is unable to voice any more opinions on the matter.

Here in this part of the forest, everything is interconnected.

You and Revissa are now a part of that community.  Long ago, your bodies were converted into sculptures made of wood.  The vines have long since unfurled from your inert bodies, which proceeded to topple over onto the dirt with a soft thud the next time a strong gust of wind washed over them.  Neither of you are aware of this, of course - you’re just statues, after all.  But statues that are full of life and potential.  

When the rain washes over you, trace elements of that energy wash off your bodies and filter into the soil.  When animals rest on you, that energy flows into them through their feet, and when moss grows in the little cracks on your wooden bodies, it eventually releases spores that carry through the air to the rest of the forest.  Though neither of you think, feel, or move anymore, you’re still very much alive, still a source of nourishment, still a valued member of the thriving forest ecosystem.

No one ever finds the two of you.  You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew, both because they never pass by where the two of you lay, and also because you’re no longer capable of thinking about them.  Just two hunks of wood, as inert as logs floating in the river.  When you tried to leave, the forest said no, decided you were too precious a resource to be allowed to leave.  The forest got its way.  And so, here you both will stay.  

Forever.

You and Revissa are now a part of that community.  Several days ago, your bodies were converted into sculptures made of wood.

Neither of you are aware of this, of course - you’re just statues, after all.  But statues that are full of life and potential.  

Lucky for you that one element of that potential is contained in the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of the adventure.  It allowed your crew to track you down and recover your wooden bodies from the ground.  After some effort, Lumina is able to use her healing magic to restore you both back to flesh, and you awaken with a start on a bed back on your ship.  Unfortunately, though they managed to save your lives, the data collection device was destroyed by the elements while you were petrified.  And so you manage to escape being a permanent resident of the forest, though your mission is, sadly, a complete failure.

[[Back to main menu-&gt;A00]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="354" name="FC04E" tags="" position="1975,175" size="100,100">With a whoosh of its landing thrusters, the Lucky Break sets down in the center of the clearing, taking up the exact same spot that the Knottie cargo ship had been in.  But that ship had already left days ago, piloted remotely to return to the central camp near the ruins.  

Your crew is here because of a message Ros’eela sent them.  While monitoring the footage from security drones circling the outpost, she happened to spy a pair of wooden statues abandoned in the forest - bearing the familiar likeness of two people she’d met not very long ago.  Anxious about their safety, she sent a message to the Lucky Break - but she used an old comm channel she remembered from years ago to send it, one which your crew had not been monitoring on account of the secrecy of the current mission.  It was only after they had given up on the search for the two of you and were about to take off that they happened to check it and find out the truth.

So now they are here, spreading out to try and find that same security footage so that they can pinpoint where it was you were caught.  Krysta is the first one to find a clue.

“Ah crap.  You’d better come take a look at this,” she says, directing everyone towards one of the large amber hunks that litter the field.

“Oh no!” says Lumina.  “Something must have happened to her after she sent us that message!”

She runs up and places a hand on the chunk of resin, closing her eyes to sense the life energy emanating from it.

“I think… she is okay in there.  All of them are.  But I have no idea how we would get her out.”

Jyumon waves a hand for a quick scrying spell, viewing the scene through the magical spectrum.  “Hrm.  This reminds me of the sacred sap used by the Squira on Del Thora.  I suspect they might have an idea how to undo it.”

“An unfortunate development,” says Vhaja.  “And certainly something to pursue once we leave the planet.  But it does not help us in discerning Melfy’s location.”  She turns to Krysta.  “I see a disabled drone on the floor there.  Do you think you can hack into it and access the security footage?”

“On it!” says the red-head.  The excitement of going on a hunt in the forest causes her latent lycanthropy to manifest, making a bushy squirrel tail poof out from her backside.

In the end, Krysta’s talents prove to be reliable.  It only takes her a few minutes to find the data, and then after cross-referencing it with a topological map of the forest they have a good idea of where you ended up.  Another hour of walking and something comes into view ahead of them.]

By now, the vines that had snared you have receded back into the earth, leaving behind nothing but a pair of wood grain statues, trapped in awkward poses.  You and Revissa, of course, are unable to speak a word, to offer any explanation as to how you ended up in this embarrassing position.

Vhaja sighs.  “I’d have expected as much from Melfy, but I had hoped Revissa would have been able to prevent this from happening.”

“Especially since this is all nature-y stuff,” says Krysta.  “Woulda thought she’d be immune or something.”

Lumina spreads her wings and starts to glide towards the two wooden sculptures.  “I will see if I can restore them,” she says.  

But she never gets that chance.  Because as soon as she starts to approach, a gust of wind blows a cloud of seed spores from some flowering branches off a nearby tree, tripping her up in a fragrant dust storm that brings her down to the ground in a sneezing fit.  The others come up to assist her, getting themselves coated in the same clingy bits of pollen, sticking to their hair, fur, and clothes.

It’s Vhaja who realizes the danger first – but by then, it’s already too late.

But already the seeds are erupting, causing spirals of creeper vines to splay out from within, growing at an impossible rate to encircle your four would-be rescuers in a moment.  Their clothing is shorn from their body as the vines cling to their skin, digging in deep enough to send paralytic toxins into their bloodstreams.

“Crap!  No!  I… c-can’t… move!” yells Krysta.

“N-no!  What is… this!  I… I… my arms… won’t….” Lumina squeals, before it becomes too difficult to speak.

Jyumon mutters the first few syllables of a fire spell to try and burn away the creeping vines, but her body freezes before she can finish the incantation.

“We… we must!  Try… try and… f-fight… it…” Vhaja begins, but her strength gives out from her and she falls to the ground weakly, legs splayed apart in an embarrassing display of helplessness.]

And just like that, they are caught.  No more words escape from their lips, as the powerful toxins get to work.  They do more than arrest your friends’ movement.  They poison them, transform them, convert them into plant matter, just like they did for you and your wife.  With unseeing wooden eyes, you can only stare ahead lifelessly as your crew succumbs to the very same trap that ended your adventure, transforming them all into motionless sculptures of carved wood.

“....”
“....”
“....”
“....”

Bound in vines, robbed of mobility, of sight, of their very consciousness, your beloved friends join you as more mute fixtures of the forest, unable to help you, or anyone else, escape from the fate that was decided for them.]

Eventually the vines recede, their work done, leaving behind six frozen victims, who will now become permanent additions to the scenery.  None of you move an inch, none of you speak a word.  And this time, there’s no one to send a distress call to ask for more help.  Everyone who could possibly have come to your aid is trapped, ensuring you and your crew will be here for a long, long time.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="356" name="FC04FX" tags="" position="2100,50" size="100,100">Deep in the forest, the trees grow tall and strong.  Their branches spread wide, hungrily drinking in the sunlight, eagerly collecting its energy which will filter through their roots into the soil below.  Here in this part of the forest, everything is interconnected.  Not quite a single organism, more like a community, a network of individuals who all eagerly share their resources with one another to ensure that everyone can thrive.  

You, Revissa, and the rest of your friends are now a part of that community.  Long ago, your bodies were converted into sculptures made of wood.  The vines have long since unfurled from your inert bodies, which proceeded to topple over onto the dirt with a soft thud the next time a strong gust of wind washed over them.  None of you are aware of this, of course - you’re just statues, after all.  But statues that are full of life and potential.  

When the rain washes over you, trace elements of that energy wash off your bodies and filter into the soil.  When animals rest on you, that energy flows into them through their feet, and when moss grows in the little cracks on your wooden bodies, it eventually releases spores that carry through the air to the rest of the forest.  Though none of you think, feel, or move anymore, you’re still very much alive, still a source of nourishment, still a valued member of the thriving forest ecosystem.

No one ever finds you.  The Knottie outpost you came from becomes lost to the elements, the amber-encased women left behind by their kin to spend eternity as glistening trophies that send dappled waves of gold onto the ground when the sunlight filters through them.  All Ros’eela’s message accomplished was ensuring that your friends rejoined you in the worst way possible, the six of you now laying inertly on the ground, doing nothing but melding in with nature.  

No intelligent eyes will ever gaze upon you again.  And though the forest knows you are here, it’s in the same way it knows about rocks, and leaves, of twigs and berries and old, forgotten logs.  You’re a part of nature, but not in any way important to it.  Just six hunks of wood, and nothing more.

Though there is still one thing about you that stands out.  A long, long time ago, you swallowed a candy capable of sending out a distress beacon on a Star Scout frequency.  And though it takes many decades, that message does eventually find a receiver.  A passing Scout tracks you down and recovers your inert bodies, brings you onto her ship and brings you to a recovery center, where, eventually, someone will find the time to restore you and your friends to flesh.

But by the time that happens, it will be nearly a hundred years since you first fell into that trap.  The galaxy will be much changed in that time, leading to a whole new set of adventures for your faithful crew.  But that’s a story for another day, and irrelevant to this one, to this mission.  A mission which, of course, has ended in abject failure.

You look between the metal-encased figure mounted on the wall, and the heavy crate holding the vacuum-sealed knottie, and decide that the former is probably safer than the latter.  After all, freezium slabs always come with a built-in thawing mechanism.  And so, you drag Ros’eela’s crate over towards the freezing device, taking a moment to familiarize yourself with the controls.

The device takes the form of a six-foot tall cylindrical chamber, equipped with canisters of sublimated metal gas to do the freezing, and colonies of nanomachines to assemble the display frame used to contain the subject.  A hatch swivels open in the front, revealing the cramped interior in which a rectangular structure reminiscent of a doorway rests in the middle.  Restraints and shackles line the sides, a contrivance meant to ensure the positioning of an unwilling volunteer for the freezing process.  Considering how wiggly the latex-encased knottie is, you figure you’ll probably need to use them.

Though you’re by no means a tech wiz, you’re still better at this sort of stuff than Revissa, so you pilot the controls while your wife sets about prying open the crate and getting Ros’eela into position.  When the case creaks open, you find the pink-skinned girl just as utterly helpless as before, writhing powerlessly beneath the grip of the goopy black slime.  Revissa quickly uses her magic to conjure some vines to curl around the slimy mass and yank it and its captive host into the freezium chamber, swiftly locking her in place within the frame.

“Now!” she yells, leaping away from the opening.

You nod and press the button to begin to process.  The hatch to the chamber slides shut, and you hear the whooshing of air as sublimated metal is sprayed over the knottie and the slime.  After a moment, a pleasant ding indicates the process is done, and you press the button to open up the chamber.  What you see inside is a pleasant surprise.]

Ros’eela is frozen solid, naked body nicely mounted on a rectangular frame, completely embedded into the thick mass of mottled metal.  That was to be expected.  But more important than that is how she is posed.  Her hands are held out in front of her in the very traditional style of freezium victims, indicating that she must have been freed from the slime in order to move her arms to get into that position.  Which means that the goop must have been destroyed by the icy blast!

Satisfied with your ingenuity, you affix a hover-pad to Ros’eela’s body to and help affix her to the wall.  But as you secure here there, a thought occurs to you.  Unfortunately, it will not be safe to thaw her out for the next few hours at least…  so perhaps it would be better to command the droids here to carry her back to the landing site to wait until you return to claim her.  

Honestly, it’s probably for the best that she says frozen for the time being.  If you were to thaw her out, she would probably report what happened to the main encampment, which would take away a potential trump card that could be used in future negotiations.  Better to keep her on ice, at least until you’re done with what you need to do on the planet.  Surely she’d understand; freezium is a part of Knottie culture after all, though to a lesser degree than bondage.  Besides… she’d look rather fetching on the wall of your quarters…

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="362" name="FE02A" tags="" position="1175,2675" size="100,100">She might be easy on the eyes, but that’s no reason to go easy on her in battle.  You’re not exactly sure what species this woman is, but it’s clear from those insectile legs of hers that she is quite dangerous.  With a practiced motion, you unsheathe your sword from its holster on your back, a heavy weapon that has served you well throughout the years.  One might think that in the age of warp drives and proton cannons that melee combat has gone out of style, but your natural strength, speed, and agility as a kemomi oftentimes makes it easy for you to close the distance between yourself and your foes before they get the chance to make use of any of that fancy technology against you.

When you chose to fight, that was what you were planning to do - to charge at the woman and keep her occupied with close quarters aggression.  Even if she proved to be stronger than you, the distraction alone would give Revissa enough time to use her nature magic to turn the tides in your favor.  It was, after all, two against one.

Unfortunately, you didn’t plan on your opponent being quite so quick on the draw.  As soon as you make your intention to engage her known, one of her back legs twitches, then points in your direction, unleashing a long, thin, expertly aimed line of finely woven spider silk.  The tether shoots through the air, snagging your sword arm by the wrist before you can even get a handle on its hilt.  You grunt in confusion, teetering off balance from the sudden pressure, which the woman capitalizes on with another shot of webbing.  This one catches you by the ankles, wrapping your legs together and sending you careening towards the ground.  As you impact the floor, a third shot of silk strikes your back, adhering to your sword and yanking it away from your body.  The blade flies through the air and lands with a clatter at the foot of a nearby tree, completely out of reach for you.

But you’re not down for the count yet!  You quickly rally, pulling yourself to your feet, ankles bound though they may be, just as Revissa reaches the end of a familiar incantation.  The ground beneath the spider-woman rumbles, and verdant green shoots begin curling around her feet.  A quick and easy entanglement spell, conjuring strong leafy vines to wrap around and restrain her.  

It would have been the perfect way to regain the advantage.  But your opponent is too clever, too quick to react.  Another glob of webbing shoots forth from the tip of her spindly leg, slamming into Revissa’s face before she can utter the final syllable of her magical attack.  Her eyes widen in confusion as her voice is cut silent by the gloopy silk, preventing the spell’s completion and banishing the summoned restraints.  The spider-woman follows up with yet more silken tethers, using them to snag Revissa’s staff and throw it into the brush, then catch her wrists and bind them tightly together.

And suddenly, it seems like you don’t have the advantage any more at all.  You silently curse the fact that you left that runic blade Vhaja gave you buried deep in your pack instead of on your belt somewhere - it would have been a huge help right now in cutting yourself free.  But there’s no time to mourn your poor decisions now - if you don’t act quickly she’ll have the two of you fully incapacitated.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="363" name="FE03" tags="" position="1475,2800" size="100,100">It’s a tale as old as time.  Muscular wolf gal walks into a forest, only for a gorgeous spider-babe to strip her naked and wrap her up, spiriting her away to her boudoir to be her helplessly bound plaything for the rest of her life.  Well… okay, maybe not a tale as old as time, but definitely one you’ve played out in your dreams and fantasies quite a lot.  But despite the frequency of those yearnings, it’s not like the encounter *has* to play out that way.  Surely you and this enticing arachnid can find some common ground?

“We come in peace!” you announce, trying to flash the gorgeous spider your most disarming smile.  “So there’s no need for any aggression or–”

But you get cut off as a string of webbing zips out from one of the women’s spindly back legs, shooting quickly over your shoulder and splattering against something behind you.  Or rather, some*one*.

“Is that so?” says the spider-woman, giving her silken tether a tug.  The motion produces a squeak of surprise from behind you from Revissa, who suddenly gets yanked across the forest floor and into the woman’s waiting arms.  “Then why was this lovely little deer about to cast a spell, hmm?”

You feel your arm start to twitch.  Every instinct is telling you to draw your sword and charge at this woman.  But your conscious mind tells you not to.  Look how quickly she caught Revissa - what would stop her from doing the same to you?  So you watch anxiously as the spider-woman’s back legs swiftly shear off your wife’s clothing, replacing it with long lines of white silk that cling tightly to her naked skin.  The entire process takes less than fifteen seconds.  When she’s done bundling her up, the spider-woman drops Revissa to the ground and sits down on her, pinning her to the forest floor with the curves of her shapely posterior.  

Well… there’s no turning back now.  You’re committed to talking this out.  

“I’m… sorry about that,” you say, keeping your arms raised.  With achingly slow movements, you reach for the strap holding your sword to your back and unfasten it, letting the weapon drop to the ground.  You do the same with your belt and blaster pistol, then kick them both away.  “But I’m serious.  We’re not here to fight or muscle in on your territory.  This is a research mission to gather data about the planet and nothing more.”

The spider-woman grins.  “Oh, you misunderstand me.  I’m not under any illusion that either of you are a threat to me.”  Another leg twitches, and silk tethers shoot out in tandem, snagging each of your wrists.  With a tug she forces your arms over your head, then drags you down to the ground and over to where she is standing.  “Whether you have a sword or a blaster or nothing at all doesn’t make any difference, because you were entirely at my mercy the moment I laid eyes on you.”

Holy crap… that domineering confidence.  The utter lack of effort it took for her to catch you.  It’s all you can do not to moan in pleasure right here.  But you keep your wits about you as she finishes reeling you in.

“No, wait – I know.  We’re not a threat!  But… we can be useful to you!”  You glance around at the fruit orchard you’re standing in, and notice something for the first time.  There seems to be signs of deliberate cultivation here.  Trees lined up in neat rows, branches pruned, the faint smell of pesticide in the air.  Could it be this lady has some kind of operation going here where she harvests these fruits?  “To your, uh, business here.  You’re growing these fruits, right?  Well, there’s something we know that you’d want to know too, but I won’t tell you if you just kidnap us straight off the — mmmphh!”

She cuts you off with a glob of webbing right between the lips.

“Oh, my silly little wolf.  You’re again under a misconception.  Calling this ‘kidnapping’ would suggest that you weren’t already mine.  But you *are* mine.  Again, you were my property the moment I laid eyes on you.  And you can’t kidnap what already belongs to you.”

Your heart beats faster, fear tensing up your muscles.  But there’s nothing you can do about that now.  You can only sit there as her spider-legs twitch and use their sharp points to slice off every scrap of clothing on your body.  And then you feel yourself spin, round and round, as her warm, wet silk glues itself over your skin, quickly cooling and hardening into a taut cocoon that covers nearly every inch of your toned and powerful, yet now utterly helpless figure.   When she’s done she tosses you over a shoulder like you were nothing more than a sack of potatoes, then does the same to your equally incapacitated wife.

“Now then, let’s take you back to your new home.”

There’s nothing you can do but go along for the ride.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="364" name="FE06" tags="" position="3525,2700" size="100,100">You are by no means a coward.  For example, you are not afraid of the prospect of being easily overpowered by this sexy spider lady, stripped naked, cocooned in silk, and carried away to her lair to be her sex slave for the rest of your life.  Nope, not scared at all… more like the opposite.

But it is that very lack of fear which convinces you that running away is the best option here.  After all, your arousal at the thought of being slathered in this gorgeous lady’s silk is probably going to be a detriment in the upcoming encounter.  How could you perform your best when the prospect of failure is so incredibly erotic?  And so, even as Revissa tenses for battle, you do the opposite, catching her gaze and then nodding back towards the way you came.

“We already planted the device,” you whisper.  “So there’s no need to stay here and get ourselves captured… captured by this super gorgeous and domineering spider-babe who would probably treat us real nice in her silken sex dungeon.”

Revissa makes an expression halfway between amusement and revulsion.

“Sometimes, I wonder why I’m in love with you,” she jokes quietly.

“Wit, confidence, compassion, and a rockin’ bod,” you answer immediately.

She kicks you in the shin, but then joins you in investigating the best direction for a tactical retreat.

The spider woman notices your reticence.  “What’s wrong,” she purrs, with a sultry voice that makes your loins ache.  “Do my new slaves not want to play?”

Oof.  She’s so domineering that she’s *already* assuming she’s got you both as slaves.  It pains you to flee from a woman who would surely show you such a good time, but alas, you have a mission to attend to. 

Working in tandem, you and Revissa silently agree to a plan of action.  You reach for your blaster, prompting the hottie to spray silk towards where you are standing - but Revissa is already prepared for that, slamming the butt of her staff against the ground to cause the earth to shake, creating a wall of tightly packed soil in front of you.  The webbing slams harmlessly against it, giving the two of you the opportunity to plan your next move.

“I’ll transform into something to carry us out of here,” Revissa says.  “Which direction should we head in?”

You think about the three viable paths that led from the forest entrance to here.  Which one would make for the best escape route?

[[Flee along the low path by the riverside-&gt;FE06A]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="365" name="FE02B" tags="" position="1175,2800" size="100,100">You might have lost your weapon, but you’re still a proud and powerful kemomi warrior.  A sharp blade is nothing compared to the raw power of your toned muscles!  You let out a bone-chilling snarl, then heave with all your might, unfurling enough of the webbing around your ankles to give you a bit more mobility.  And that’s all you need to send yourself hurtling towards her at top speed, lowering your shoulder as you move to tackle her to the ground.

The spider-woman just lets out a raspy chuckle.  Her back legs twitch, and lines of silk shoot out, catching onto nearby tree branches to allow her to hoist herself up and over your ill-thought charge.  Once you sail past, she nimbly leaps onto your back, using her momentum to topple you over onto the ground once more - though this time with the addition of her body weight expertly applied to pin you down beneath her.

“How cute,” she says with a playful smile, the smaller of her back legs extending themselves towards you.  Before you can make an effort to try and throw her off, the sharp edges of the appendages get to work, moving across your figure to swiftly shear off every scrap of clothing from your body.  Boots, pants, cape, shirt, even undergarments, they offer no resistance, falling away to expose the full extent of your naked body to her eager eyes.

You can’t help but let out an instinctive whimper as she looks you over.  Lupine instincts can propel you into a fight, but they just as quickly will tell you that you should be scampering away with your tail between your legs when things go south.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like this lady has any intention of letting that happen.  You make a token effort to buck her off of you, but she has the better leverage, and clearly knows how to use it.  All it takes is her grabbing your shoulders with her humanoid hands to keep you pinned beneath her, giving her the time she needs to unfold her long back legs and prime them to start producing more silk.

Despite the warmth of the gloppy webbing, a shiver runs down your spine as it starts to adhere to your naked skin.  The fresh silk takes only a moment to fully harden, forming itself into a shear, slightly elastic barrier between your body and the air.  She starts with your legs, fully wrapping them together, cutting off your ability to kick her away as her spindly appendages creep higher.  Your arms come next, roughly pulled above your head then firmly bound in place.  And then, once your main methods of resistance are robbed from you, she picks you up into the air, holding you in a firm embrace as her long legs begin spinning you round and round.  You feel woozy as the world whirls past you, sending you into a dizzying confusion as her silk clings to the rest of your unprotected body.

Within the space of a few seconds, she’s gotten you totally wrapped up - cocooned from the feet all the way to the neck.  One final glob of webbing glues your lips shut, followed by another long tether around your face to make sure you don’t just spit it out.  And then, just like that, you’re beaten.  She gives your shoulder a triumphant squeeze as she drops you to the ground, turning her attention to the other prey in her sights.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="366" name="FE02C" tags="" position="1050,2675" size="100,100">Without your sword, you’re basically a sitting duck.  There’s no chance of winning if you don’t get it back.  So the only thing you can do is plunge forward, reckless though it may be, making a dive towards the tree where your weapon was thrown.  You land with a thud beside it, causing a sharp pain to ripple through your shoulder as your left side impacts the ground.  But this is no time to let yourself be distracted.  As you stand back up, you maneuver the blade into your hands, finally feeling the comforting touch of reinforced metal against your fingers.

For… about three seconds.  Before another glob of webbing shoots from above, snagging the sword from your grip once more.  You look up to find the spider-woman lounging lazily in the branches over your head, making a tut-tut motion with her finger as she tosses the weapon away yet again.

“Don’t you know that you could hurt yourself playing with dangerous toys like this?”

You snarl ferociously at her sneering face.  “The idea was to hurt *you* with it,” you yell.

That elicits a dismissive chuckle.

“Oh, don’t worry.  I’m not in any danger at all right now.”

And then she pounces.  Using some lines of silk almost like a slingshot, she propels herself downwards, crashing into your body and slamming you back against the floor - though this time with the addition of her body weight expertly applied to pin you down beneath her.

“How cute,” she says with a playful smile, the smaller of her back legs extending themselves towards you.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="367" name="FE02D" tags="" position="1050,2800" size="100,100">You know you’re a good fighter.  You know you’re strong.  You know you handle yourself well under pressure.  But you also know none of that matters when it comes to fighting sexy spider ladies.  No matter how you slice it, if you try and face a silk-spinning hottie in combat, you’re going to lose, and you’re going to get wrapped up.  It is, quite simply, just the way of things.  Perhaps it comes down to fate, or, perhaps, it comes down to the fact that this is your fetish and on a deep level you *want* it to happen.  Or perhaps you’re not actually as good a fighter as you think you are.

Whatever the reason, you know that if you want to escape the situation you’ve found yourself in, it’s not going to be you that does it.  Revissa is your only hope.  Which means your only real option is to holster your pride and accept the fact someone else gets to be the hero this time.  So with that resolution in your mind, you turn and rush towards your restrained lover.  If you could just get her hands and lips free, she could surely come up with a spell that will overpower the fiendishly sexy arachnid.

It’s a good plan.  A noble one.  Almost certainly your best chance, given the circumstances.  But the one thing it isn’t is a *successful* plan.  Because no sooner do you start closing the distance towards your wife before you feel yet more webbing slink around your ankles, firmly glomming your legs together.  Your balance thus gives out and you fall forward, landing face-first onto Revissa’s welcomingly soft chest.  A pained grunt escapes her gagged lips as she sees her wife’s desperate attempt to save her get summarily cut short, and a fearful gleam forms in her eyes as the spidery culprit behind the snaring skitters over to loom above the two of you on the ground.

“Oh my!  How dashing!  Were you trying to save her?” the woman says with mock sweetness.  “So cute.  I was almost tempted to let you do it, just so I could catch her again.”

Things are looking bad and tension is running high.  Your fight or flight instinct kicks in, and since flight is no longer on the table, your gut picks the only other option before your brain even has time to register what it’s doing.

“Don’t you lay a hand on her!” you snarl, twisting your body so that you can hop up into a standing position even with your legs bound together.

A dismissive twitch of two of her back legs throws you right back down to the ground.  And then a gooey glob of fresh-spun silk suddenly jams itself between your lips, sealing off any further acts of bravado.  The woman’s human hands curl around your wrists, forcing your arms together above your head before more webbing is wound around them with incredible dexterity.  She’s good at what she does, you realize - damn good.  In an instant any mobility you had has been completely cut off.

Behind you, Revissa makes one last, desperate bid to roll to the side to put some distance between her and the spider-woman, but your assailant easily sees through the ploy.  A shot of webbing glues itself to her back, and with a tug your wife is in the woman’s grip.  Several strands of silk are swiftly swirled around her legs, cutting off any future plays at mobility.  And with a gentle push she is forced back down to the ground beside you.  You both can only look up with fearful eyes as you realize that you’ve been beaten - and are now entirely at this woman’s mercy.

[[That’s a wrap-&gt;FE02DA]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="368" name="FE02E" tags="" position="900,2675" size="100,100">As the spider lady walks towards you, you scramble to come up with some way to fight back.  Yet every option that comes to mind seems doomed to fail from the start.  She already has the advantage over you, meaning that any action you take is just going to be swatted aside.  In a moment it’ll be too late to do anything at all, but there’s nothing you can throw at her that she won’t likely have a counter for.

Wait… *throw* at her?

And then it hits you.  *You’re* not strong enough or fast enough to beat her.  But… maybe something else is.

“Aww, what’s the matter, little wolfie?  Too scared to fight back?”

She’s taking her time to get to you, perhaps seeing the fear in your eyes.  Noticing this, Revissa tries to make a break for it, but the spider lady spots this immediately, shooting a line of web at her ankle to catch her foot, then twisting it over a branch to suspend her upside-down.  For all her magical ability, Revissa isn’t going to be able to help you here.  Or rather, perhaps she has already helped you as much as was needed.  

Because, when the spider woman turns to string her up, you manage to slip open the flap of your pack and pull out something from inside of it.  It’s a perfectly round sphere, coated in a thin layer of freezium metal.  You found this at the Knottie outpost, a slime symbiote kept in a containment field, and you saw what it could do.  Ros’eela was caught by it in an instant, only freed when you doused the monster with sub-zero gasses.  And if it was that good at trapping one bondage expert, why not another?

“Scared?” you say.  “Not at all.  In fact – I’m having a ball!”

Using as much strength as you can muster, you hurl the sphere of slime right towards her.  But even with this brilliant plan, your enemy proves herself to be much faster.  With lightning-quick speed she flicks a line of webbing to catch the projectile in the air, then gives it a tug to throw it away behind her.

“Come on,” she says with a sigh.  “Did you really think you were going to take me out with, what, a grenade?”

Your heart sinks when you see your plan fail… but then it starts to race when you see that it hasn’t.  The impact from the web shot cracked the freezium shell, and now the symbiote has twisted itself into a swirling line, curling up the length of webbing she used to toss it away and heading right for her body!

“More than a grenade,” you say with a smirk.  “More like… a friend?  Or at least a mutual enemy.”

“What?” groans the spider lady, annoyed at your cryptic wordplay, but that soon turns to a shout of surprise as the advancing slime creature suddenly gloms itself over her back legs.  “Ack!  What is th — get it off!”

And then she’s pushed to the ground.  Her spindly spider limbs are immobilized first, bent over backwards at an odd angle and forced together behind her back.  But the goop swiftly climbs past those and onto her shoulders, melding itself against her skin as it dissolves away her clothing.  She trips and stumbles forward, flopping over onto the ground as it snags her arms and restrains them in front of her, just beneath her chest.  Her legs get covered next, bending into themselves as she is pressed in on all sides, covered all the way up to her neck.

“What have you done to me?!” she shrieks.

“Me?  I haven’t done anything,” you say, lazily sifting through your bag to retrieve the knife you left all the way at the bottom.  The runic blade easily cuts through the silken bonds she had tied you with, and does the same for Revissa when you approach her next.

In a moment, the spider lady will be totally encased.  But there’s no reason to think that the goopy slime will stop with her.  Probably best to leave now while she’s still got some resistance left in her, since once she’s fully enveloped you and Revissa will be next on its target list.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="369" name="FE02BA" tags="" position="1175,2925" size="100,100">While the spider woman was bundling you up, you held on to a vain hope that she would take long enough for Revissa to get herself free and offer you some aid.  But as the monster-lady leaps through the air, those hopes are swiftly dashed.

Your wife, gagged and bound at the wrists, had been lamely trying to get at the runic dagger Vhaja had entrusted you with to cut herself free.  But she has only managed to pull it from its sheath before the spider is upon her, tackling her hard into the grass.  Revissa has barely enough time to make a panicked squeak before she is picked up and spun around, just like you were.  You catch a brief glimpse of her naked body as the clothes are shorn from her frame, but that quickly gets replaced with a cocoon of silk as she is bundled up, just as tightly and completely as you are.  Once she is finished, she is tossed down beside you, squirming and helpless, as your captor towers over your restrained bodies.

“Well, that was fun.  Now let’s get you back to your new home!”

Bound as the two of you are, you have no power to resist.  With surprising strength, she scoops you both up, slinging you one over each shoulder, then hoists herself back into the trees, carrying you away to parts unknown.

[[Get carried away-&gt;FE02BB]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="370" name="FE02BB" tags="" position="1175,3050" size="100,100">The ride eventually takes you to the extensive network of caves and cliffs ringing the forest, where she ducks into an entrance to the mountains concealed with some expertly woven threads.  You’re plunged into darkness, carried through twisting tunnels until you arrive at what seems to be a living area of some sort.  Several more women of the same species as her emerge to check out her newest catch.  She is only too happy to oblige.  Finding a suitable spot, she anchors your legs to the floor with thick, clingy strands, doing the same with your arms to an outcropping of rock above your head.  Revissa is treated even worse, suspended upside-down by her feet, her long braid of hair dangling in the air beneath her.

The spider-women all gather round as your captor shows you off.

“How lovely!” says one.

“They’ll really brighten up the place,” says another.

“So cute!” says a third.  “Do you mind if I make them kiss?”

She doesn’t ask for a response, sort of swinging Revissa over and lining the two of you up so your gagged lips touch.  The two of you can do nothing but mewl weakly in protest as you’re treated as nothing more than fun new toys to mess around with.  That’s all you are to them - wrapped up bundles for them to play with whenever the mood strikes them, left out in the hallway as communal property of their growing conclave.  And there is nothing, literally nothing, either of you can do to stop them.  Bound, gagged, totally restrained, completely helpless, you and Revissa are thus reduced to mere elements of interior design.  Trussed up bundles that add some flair to the otherwise dreary cave system, and some entertainment to help get them to relax after a long work day.  That is all you are now - and all you’ll be for as long as you remain their prisoners.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="371" name="FE02BAX" tags="" position="1175,3175" size="100,100">At first, you hold out hope for rescue.  That someone, somehow, will find you deep in these caves, and will manage to set you free.  But as days become weeks, and weeks become years, it becomes fully apparent that there will be no such luck.

As the years pass, you occasionally pick up snippets of conversation as your arachnid captors walk by, and you eventually piece together why they are here.  These women are Spider Princesses - half-breed offspring of the Spider Queen race.  And they, like their full-blooded progenitors, can modify the nature of their silk by carefully managing their diet.  And it just so turns out that the fruits in the orchard you encountered in the forest can confer unto their webbing the properties shared by the rest of the ‘ghost matter’ on the planet.  Namely, those bound in the silk are kept young and healthy for as long as they remain in contact with it.

What they’ve done here is created an *export business*.  Cultivating and harvesting the fruits to sell to Spider Queens across the galaxy, allowing them to turn their webbing into the ideal material to keep prisoners in permanent captivity.  You and Revissa are some of the first of the ‘lucky’ winners of this fate, but you are far from the last.  Every once in a while you see more women get strung up as decoration in the caves, until there’s not really any more space nearby.  Business must be booming.  And the more successful they become, the more powerful they are - and the less likely a daring rescue will be.

You have no idea what happened to the rest of your crew.  Maybe they searched for but never found you, and sadly left the planet empty-handed.  Or, more likely, they were also captured by the Princesses - or some other peril on the planet, and remain just as doomed as you are.  Whatever the case, it is clear that this is your life now.  As the years become centuries, and the centuries become eternity, you and Revissa will never be more than cocooned captives lining the halls of these endless caverns.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="372" name="FE02BAY" tags="" position="1025,3175" size="100,100">The spider-women keep the two of you for days - for weeks, even.  The hours begin to blend into one another, disconnecting you from the passage of time, without even the rising or setting of the sun to guide you in these dark caverns.  But eventually, you get cut free.  Feel yourselves being carried, loaded up onto a transport.  And then you open your eyes and find yourselves aboard the Lucky Break.

Thanks to your Star Scout homing beacon, Vhaja and the others were able to track you down.  But there were too many spider-women to enact a rescue.  Instead, your crew was forced to trade their mission for your safety, selling the data about the planet to secure your freedom. The research was discarded, the planet abandoned, any hope of gathering intel surrendered.  

Sadly, your choices have led to failure.  You and the crew return to Kemomi space with your tails between your legs, nothing to show for your efforts.  But at least it’s better than spending the rest of your life cocooned in a cavern.  And from now on, you’ll always wonder whether your choices could have led to someplace better.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="373" name="FE02DA" tags="" position="1050,2925" size="100,100">Now that she’s got you both totally restrained, the spider woman’s movements become more leisurely as she finishes bundling you up.  She starts with you, tilting your bound body into her arms, sliding you up onto her lap as her back legs wind more and more taut silk over your defenseless skin.  As you get bundled up, her humanoid hands have their fun with you, eagerly running themselves along your taut muscles, squeezing your breasts, stroking your tail, and deftly plunging between your lower lips.

To be perfectly honest, the whole thing is incredibly erotic.  For Revissa’s sake, you try your best to pretend you aren’t enjoying it, but you can only ignore the warm feelings bubbling up from your loins for so long.  Eventually your eyes roll back, your body twitches, soft groans emanate from your throat, and slick wetness leaks from your nether region onto your captor’s awaiting fingers.  As she licks her digits dry, Revissa glares at her hatefully, furious that she was forced to watch her wife be used as a plaything.

The woman just smiles  “Oh don’t worry, you’re next, my little cutie.”

And she *is* next.  Now you’re forced to watch as Revissa is subjected to the same treatment you were.  Gently and lovingly toyed with by hungry fingers and lusty lips, bound up in silk and wound up with sexual tension, that, try as she might, is impossible to contain.  She lasts longer than you did, but not *much* longer, and after a few minutes you see your wife pitch and buck in release, grinding her hips into the fingers probing within her.  When the spider woman finishes, Revissa can only just manage to narrow her eyes with disdain as the woman sets her down next to you.

“You’re just so adorable, both of you!” she trills, giving each of your breasts a squeeze with her hands.  “And I can tell you love each other very much.  Hrm… I think you’d make wonderful gifts for Merry, actually.”

You have no idea who this Merry is, but no more information is forthcoming.  Instead, your captor just scoops you both up and tosses you both over a shoulder, then starts web-slinging herself towards the cliffs that surround the west side of the forest.  Once there, she ducks into a hidden cave entrance between some rocks, pulling the two of you into darkness.

[[Meet Merry-&gt;FE02DB]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="374" name="FE02DB" tags="" position="1050,3050" size="100,100">Inside the cave it&#39;s basically pitch black.  Your eyes are pretty sharp, but even you can’t ever see more than a few feet in front of you at any time.  But the spider woman seems perfectly capable of navigating without light, picking out twists and turns through the extensive cave system.  At this point, even if you were to somehow escape the webbing, you’d have no idea how to actually get back to daylight anyway.

Eventually she reaches an area that seems to have the trappings of domestic living, and carries you into a section cordoned off by sheets of webbing to be someone’s home.

“Merry, look what I’ve got for you!” she calls out brightly.  “A couple of floofy cuties for you to play with!”

For a moment there is silence, but it is soon broken by an excited squee echoing across the walls of the cavern.   Before long, another spider-woman emerges.  This one has bright pink skin and big, beady green eyes, wearing a pretty silken dress and with fuzzy fur covering her back legs.  She screams again with delight when she lays eyes on her new best friends.

“Eeeeeeee!  Omigosh!  Look how cute and fuzzy they are!” she exclaims.

You and Revissa can only mewl helplessly into your gags as you are again poked and prodded and groped by the silk-clad cutie.  Your captor explains how the two of you fought and struggled so valiantly for each other’s sake, how protective each of you was about your partner.  She embellishes the story quite a bit, adding in dramatic swordplay and a romantic kiss beneath the flickering lights of the planet’s aurora, making your quick and decisive capture far more cinematic than it was in reality.

“Aaahhhh!  You two love each other, don’t you!  Well, you should!  You’re both so adorable!  You make the best couple!”  She looks towards the bearer of her gifts.  “And… I can keep them?”

“Of course.  My gift to you,” the red spider-woman says.

“Forever and ever?”

“It’s not like they’re going anywhere.  You can have them as long as you want them.  And when you’re done with them they can be communal property instead.”

“Yay! Thank you so much!  I promise I’ll take good care of them!  I’ll brush their hair and tails, and I’ll play with them every single day!”

You and Revissa let out a pair of fearful ‘mmphs’ as you realize you’re basically going to be this spider-cutie’s pets.  

And so the two of you are left in Merry’s expert care.  She wastes no time modifying the positioning of your webbing, cutting bits and pieces here and there, but never enough to give you any mobility or leverage to escape.  You and Revissa are pressed up together, arms behind your backs, naked breasts squished together warmly.  It is, altogether… exactly the sort of thing you’ve fetishized about for most of your life.  Can you be blamed if your tail starts wagging back and forth?

Revissa rolls her eyes at your excitement.  Altogether a rather subdued reaction from both of you, considering the fact these ladies have not, at any point, given any indication they plan on letting you go.  ‘Forever and ever’ is a long time, after all.  But at this point, you have no choice in the matter, so you might as well just enjoy it.

To your surprise, you feel a tearing at your lips as the webbing used to gag you is pulled away.  You and Revissa both start to murmur something towards your cheerful captor, but before any words get out your heads are grabbed and pushed together firmly.

“Now kiiisssssss…” she says happily.]

And so kiss you do.  It’s not like you have any choice.  Though maybe you’d have liked to get one final word in.  Because a moment later and globs of silk are woven around the backs of your heads, gluing your lips together into a kiss that will never end.

Well, there are worse fates to endure.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="375" name="FE02EA" tags="" position="900,2925" size="100,100">Revissa glances behind you as you usher her away.

“I don’t know about just leaving that slime thing there,” she says.  “A foreign creature like that can really mess up an ecosystem.”

“I’m sure the forest can handle it,” you tell her soothingly.  “Besides, that spider-lady was already foreign to the ecosystem.  So we’re just correcting the imbalance.”

Revissa doesn’t seem so sure, but it’s not like she wants to take on the latex goo herself, either.  So in the end you leave it to its devices, and pray that the forest will be able to accommodate the addition of a new predator.  The last thing you hear before you leave the fruit grove entirely is a scream of rage that quickly gives way to a muffled grunt of despair, presumably as the slime finishes fully encasing the spider woman’s face.

And so, with her taken care of, and your mission complete, you’re free to escape the forest at your leisure.  You carefully retrace your steps, making sure to avoid encountering any of the same perils you faced on your way up here.  Thankfully, there are no further interruptions, and within the hour you find yourself back at the entrance.  Revissa makes a few more token protests about the way you handled things, but even she has to admit your method was preferable to getting caught and cocooned by the shapely arachnid.  

If anything, she should be thanking *you*, since you gave up on the pleasure of being dominated by such a sexy villain.  Though you wisely don’t voice that thought as the edge of the woods comes into sight ahead of you.

[[Exit the forest-&gt;FE07]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="376" name="FE02EB" tags="" position="900,2800" size="100,100">The slime is too dangerous to get closer to, you know.  *Unless* you managed to incapacitate it somehow.  You realize that you still have a canister of freezium that you salvaged from the outpost earlier, and that might be just what you need to permanently remove the gooey creature as a threat.

“Get this thing… off of me!” the spider lady shrieks, uselessly squirming against the rubbery casing.

You smile at her as you pull out the canister.  “Hey, no need to yell.  We’re all friends here, right?  My name is Melfy, by the way.  And this is my wife Revissa.  What’s yours?”

“Tula!” the woman yells.  “A name you’ll be yelling out in pleasure once I have you both in my dungeons!”

You have to give her credit for her confidence.

“Yeah… about that.  As fun as that sounds – and it honestly does sound like fun – I’m afraid that’s not gonna be happening.  At least not in this timeline.”

“It will just as soon as I get out of th – mmmphh!”

The slime symbiote seems to have had enough of her, and now spreads up over her lips.  Surely if you gave it time, it would expand its mass to attack you, as well.  But you’re not gonna give it that chance.  

Still smiling, you aim the canister at the squirming arachnid and pull off the top.  When you do, a stream of hyper-chilled, aerated metal particles stream towards her, quickly subjecting the slime to sub-zero temperatures.  However, you’re careful not to get it so cold that it shatters.  Instead, you pull back at the last moment, right after it expands to completely encircle Tula’s protesting face.  The spider woman grunts and squirms, and the slime monster ceases all movement, unable to survive at that temperature.  But though it’s no longer moving, it’s still thick, tight, and rubbery, trapping the spider cutie completely in an inescapable sheathe.]

“I shoulda gotten a job as an exterminator,” you say with a grin, bringing the canister up to your face so that you can blow away the remaining bits of chilled vapor like it was steam from an overheated blaster pistol.  It might have looked cool, had there not been a tiny bit of leftover gas left in the container which chose that moment to erupt.  You end up losing consciousness for half an hour when your face and upper body become encased in metal, only freed thanks to Revissa’s helpful intervention.

Luckily, when you awaken, you find that Tula is still safely tucked away in rubber, unable to do anything other than writhe and squirm.  She’s yours for the taking - and you see no reason not to take her.  You scoop her up easily and sling her over your shoulder, ignoring her muffled grunts of protest, as you begin the long walk back to the entrance of the forest.  

“You know, keeping a pet is a big responsibility,” Revissa says jokingly, though even she can’t help but trace the appealing shape of your captive’s figure with her eyes.

“But they’re also a lot of fun, if cared for properly,” you reply, giving Tula’s rump a nice, firm squeeze.

Yes, she’ll make a fine trophy of your accomplishments on this mission, assuming you make it home in one piece.  Of course, you’ll probably turn her over to the proper authorities… eventually, but before that, she’s all yours, and you can think of a lot of things to do with a helpless spider-babe.

And so, your victory assured, you return to the entrance of the forest with no further interruptions, eager to put the trees behind you.

It was a long and difficult struggle, but in the end you braved the dangers of the forest and made it to the heart of the woods.  There, you found an orchard full of fruits, as well as a gorgeous spider-lady, but you avoided capture at her hands and placed the data collection device central to the completion of your mission.

As you and Revissa leave the cover of the trees, you glance down at your communicator, bringing up a readout that shows information is being transmitted from the device you just installed.  It seems everything is successful.  And so, feeling invigorated, you head back to the landing site with a bounce in your step.

This is very much not good.  As much as you enjoy being kidnapped and lustily groped by a powerful and domineering spider-babe, you can’t just let her take you to her lair like this.  You have a mission to do, and friends to get back to.  And yet… how could you possibly escape?

The only thing that comes to mind is convincing her of what you said before - that you have a use other than as a sexy plaything.  But how to tell her that when her silk seals your lips shut?  (if: $gagtalk is true)[If only you still had that gag-talk translator you found in the outpost - but it’s resting along with the rest of the gear she removed from your body on the forest floor.]  Well… then, you’ll just have to show her your intentions with something other than words.  So, as she carries you deeper into the cavern, you start making happy and erotic moans into the silk filling your mouth, nuzzling your head against her shoulder and swishing your tail along whatever bare skin of hers it can find.

“What… what are you doing?” she asks, as your fuzz finds a ticklish spot on her arm.  

“Mmmphhh…” you say, hopefully in an alluring way, as you bat your eyes at her invitingly.

She raises an eyebrow.  “What… you turned on or something?”

You nod your head, eliciting a bemused snort from the woman.

“Well, fine, then.  If you’re so horny.”

She stops and sets you down against a wall, looking you over curiously.  You squirm against the silk in a way that causes your breasts to jostle vigorously, drawing the spider woman’s eyes towards you.  This gives you the opportunity to spare a glance towards your wife, who looks equal parts irritated at you and terrified at the situation you’re in.  You try to give her a comforting glance, but it doesn’t do much to alleviate her stress.  Especially when the spider woman strings her up with some silky strands, suspending her in front of the cavern entrance you came in from.  Revissa squirms weakly, her exposed chest jiggling even more invitingly than yours did.

“Stay right there,” she says to Revissa, giving her breasts a playful squeeze.  “Because if this one doesn’t satisfy, I’ll have to go round two with you.”

You make a confident grunt in reply.  There’s no question whether you’ll succeed – after all, you do your best work when the odds are stacked against you.

“Alright then, little wolf.  Show me just how eager you are to please.”

Sitting down, she spreads her legs and slides away the cloth from her crotch.  And then she grabs your head and pulls it in towards her lap.  With a poke from one of the sharp points of a back leg, she tears away your gag - though before you’re able to say anything you find your face shoved between the unfolded petals of her sex.

“Do a good job and… hrm.  I don’t know.  I’m not going to let you go.  But maybe I’ll let you do this again.  *If* I’m feeling generous.”

Well, that’s not exactly the most promising of opportunities, but it’s an opening all the same.  And so you plunge into your task with gusto, showing this spider-babe just how good you are with your tongue when it’s not covered in silk.  And you are, in fact, quite good.  Over the course of the next hour you manage to stimulate her to completion several times, filling yourself with a sweet flowing nectar from within her that tastes, oddly, quite a lot like the juice from the fruit you bit into when you first arrived at the orchard.  Interesting.

You keep going until the arachnid woman relaxes her grip on your head, giving you the opportunity to actually get a word in.  

“I can’t help but notice you taste the same as the fruits that you were growing down there,” you venture, trying to take advantage of her while she’s in a relaxed state to pump her for some information.  “What exactly are you doing here?”

She must be in a good mood, because she actually answers you.  “Like you said, we’re growing those fruits.  Everything on this planet is made out of this special kind of material - strong, sturdy stuff that keeps people healthy so long as they are in contact with it.”

“People smarter than me named it “Ghost Matter”, you say, “I guess because technically everything on this world is dead or something.”

The woman nods.  “Sure, whatever you want to call it.  Well, it turns out, when we incorporate the fruit into our diets, it transfers the benefits of the stuff into our silk.”  She reaches out and tugs on the snug contours of your cocoon.  “Makes our webbing stronger and keeps our prisoners fresh, no need for using drugs or chemicals or time-consuming maintenance - they’ll be as hale and healthy as the day they were caught.”

“And you wanna… make a business selling the stuff?  Are there a lot more of your kind?”

She shrugs.  “Not *that* many of us, exactly.  But plenty of our… ‘mothers’, I guess you could say.  I’m a Spider Princess - basically a half-breed descendant of a Spider Queen.”

Spider Queens!  You know a whole lot about them. You’ve met a few in your travels around the galaxy… and many more in your dreams and fantasies.  Half woman, half spider, tall and powerful hybrids known for their lust for conquest and proclivity to accumulate silk-bound slaves.

“Gotcha.  So… should I call you ‘princess’ then?” you say with a playful grin.

She groans.  “Ugh.  Not that it matters since I’m going to gag you again in a few seconds.  But my name is Tula.”

Progress!  You’ve learned her name.  And with that opening, you might have a chance to convince her to forgo dragging you back to her lair just yet.  But what to say?  You’ve probably only got one chance…

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="379" name="FE03B" tags="" position="1600,2925" size="100,100">“So… Tula,” you say, trying to sound all professional and businesslike, despite the fact that you’re naked and wrapped up in a cave, totally at this woman’s mercy.  “I get the sense that you’re a shrewd businesswoman, and that you understand an opportunity when it’s presented to you.  And it just so happens, I have just such an opportunity before you.”

The spider woman snorts, amused at your boldness.  “Yeah?  And what’s that?”

“Well, you’re trying to get an export service off the ground, right?  Getting these tasty fruits into the hands of spiders who need them?  I just so happen to be a seasoned adventurer who has a number of contacts… including a few Spider Queens.”

Tula rolls her eyes.  “Really, a kemomi like you knows a Spider Queen.  Don’t take this as a compliment, but looking like you do, any Spider Queen with any amount of self respect would scoop you up for her harem the second she laid eyes on you – like I’ve done just now.”

Too late, you very much do take that as a compliment.  

“Be that as it may, the fact is true.  I actually used to date a Queen, if you could believe it.  Her name was Azkumo, really nice girl…”

Now Tula breaks out into laughter.  “Really, Azkumo?  The holo-film star, you mean?”

“Well, yeah, but I knew her before she got her big break.  Though I called it off because she wasn’t aggressive enough with her silk.”

In your defense, every word of what you’ve said is true.  But Tula doesn’t seem to be buying it.  

“Azkumo wasn’t… *aggressive* enough?  Do you seriously expect me to believe you spent a single night with her and it didn’t end with you locked away in her harem halls forever?”

“Like I said, she didn’t have a harem at the time…”

“Yeah, sure.  Alright, you know what?  I haven’t laughed like this in a long, long time, so let’s make a deal.  If you can get Azkumo, famed film star, on the line and get her to give me an autograph, I’ll let you both go.  How does that sound?”

“Deal!”

You’d reach out to shake… but you’re a bit tied up at the moment.  So you just wiggle uselessly a bit as Tula sets her communicator down in front of you.

“Well?  I’m waiting.”

Realization dawns at this point.  “Erm… well I probably still have her comm channel on my own device… but you kinda stripped me back in the forest,” you say lamely.

“You mean you don’t commit your exes’ comm addresses to memory?”

“...no?”

“What a shame.  Well then, I guess let’s just get this gag back on you and we’ll get you to your new home here after all.”

“Wait!  Um… hold on, I’m sure I can find her contact info on the galactic holo-net…”

Tula humors you and allows you to try.  But despite your searching, the best you can do is get the info for the ad agency that handles her publicity.  Running out of options, you do give them a call… but it doesn’t exactly go as planned.  In fact, one thing leads to another, and you end up ‘hiring’ yourself as a model for them instead…

[[Become a star-&gt;FE03BA]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="380" name="FE03C" tags="" position="1475,3050" size="100,100">“So… Tula,” you say, trying to sound all professional and businesslike, despite the fact that you’re naked and wrapped up in a cave, totally at this woman’s mercy.  “I get the sense that you’re a shrewd businesswoman, and that you understand an opportunity when it’s presented to you.  And it just so happens, I have just such an opportunity before you.”

The spider woman snorts, amused at your boldness.  “Yeah?  And what’s that?”

“Well, as I have just demonstrated, I have a service that I can perform, one that you seemed to be quite satisfied with.  And though you may have my wife and I totally trapped, I still have the option to withhold that service from you if I so choose.”

She glances towards Revissa. “Aww… you think of her as your wife?”

That gives you pause.  “I mean… she *is* my wife.  It’s not a matter of opinion–”

But then Tula gives you a tug, pulling you backwards into her arms.  And now, when she looks down at you, all sense of amusement is gone from her eyes – all you can see is an overwhelming confidence, a cold, steely dominance reflected back at you.

“You really don’t understand.  She’s your wife only if *I* say she is, because I caught you, and I *own* you.  You think you have something to offer me?  Well think again - I don’t negotiate with my possessions.”

You try to voice a counterpoint, but she swiftly seals off your lips with more webbing.

“So let me be clear here.  Yes, I was satisfied with your service.  And yes, I expect you to perform that service on my command.  But you don’t have a choice in the matter.  You *will* do what I say.”

Fear starts to well up in your chest as you realize this negotiation is going south for you.  But you at least have the presence of mind to grunt and shake your head at her assumption.

“No.  You will.  Because I own you, and I own this pretty little thing too.  Which means I get to decide whether or not you ever get to see your ‘wife’ again.  So here’s how this is going to go down.  Both of you will spend the rest of your lives in my possession.  You get no say in anything, no decisions, no sympathy.  But – and this is a big but – if you prove to be a tool that I am fond of, I will treat you with respect.   For example, if I kept you in my bedroom, and this other one out in the open caverns for public usage, I might, on occasion, let the two of you see each other.  If I’m feeling generous.”

Her eyes narrow and she pulls your face in close.

“But *only* if my sex toy does exactly what I tell it to, every time, without resistance or complaint.  Because if one time - even one *single* time – it doesn’t do what I expect it to, then I’d have no reason not to shove it in a box and ship it off to some distant planet where it would never get to lay eyes on its partner again.”

Your heart sinks as you realize she’s found the leverage she needs.  The prospect of never seeing Revissa again would be too much to bear.  And so… you have no choice but to submit to her, be the compliant, defeated slave she expects you to be.

“Do you understand?”

You nod your head slowly.  It’s over.  She’s won.  And for the rest of your life, you’ll do exactly what she asks of you.

“Good.”  She slings you over her shoulder, carrying you off deeper into the cavern, leaving Revissa behind.  All you can do is watch helplessly as she vanishes from sight, knowing that your new owner is the only one who can grant you the happiness of seeing her.

A few minutes later, you are brought to her private quarters, and roughly tossed onto the sheets of a bed.

Looking up helplessly, you watch her disrobe, then drape herself over your cocooned form.

“Now then… let’s make sure my new toy still works.  Though remember, if you do anything with that tongue other than stick it between my legs, anything at all – even a single word – you’re never seeing your wife again.”

And so, as she peels off your gag, you silently get to work, performing your function as the sex toy that you are.

And it just so happens, I have just such an opportunity before you.”

The spider woman snorts, amused at your boldness.  “Yeah?  And what’s that?”

“Well, you’re trying to get a new business started, right?  Out here on a remote planet, with little resources or infrastructure to rely on.  I mean, you’re living in a cave, which shows to me you are lacking in funding for your venture.”

“We’re part spider,” she says dismissively.  “Caves are a natural habitat for our people.”

You’re not buying it.  They might be part spider, but they’re also part Queen.  “Oh, sure, you’re *capable* of camping out in some musty old caves.  But if you were happy with roughing it you wouldn’t be starting a big export business.  I’ve seen the inside of a traditional Spider Queen battle-yacht; they’re some of the most opulent vessels in the galaxy!”

Tula rolls her eyes.  “Please, you expect me to believe you’ve seen the inside of a battle-yacht and aren’t some Queen’s harem slave?  Far more capable adventurers than you have tried, and failed, to escape from the grips of a Queen.”

“I mean… I’ve seen them… in holo films,” you admit.  “But regardless.  You’re living in a cave, but you’d rather have more, wouldn’t you?  Well, what if I told you I knew the location of an abandoned settlement not too far from here?  It might not be as nice as a battle-yacht, but it’s got food, shelter, and supplies - as well as harvesting equipment you could probably use to speed up your fruit-collecting business.”

She raises an eyebrow.  “Are you talking about the Knotties?  We know about their camp at the ruins.  It’s too far away to be useful- and we don’t have the numbers to take it over, anyway.”

You nod.  “Yes, the Knotties.  But I’m not talking about their main camp.  There’s a smaller outpost in the middle of the forest, only an hour’s walk from here.  They had… a bit of trouble with the local flora, and won’t be using it anymore.  Making it ripe for the picking.”

The spider woman considers for a moment, but then comes to a conclusion.  “Interesting.  Alright, I have a deal for you.  You show me to this supposed outpost.  And in exchange, I keep you, and your friend here, for the rest of your lives as my submissive sex slaves, never letting you go.”

You give her a blank stare.  “Erm… that’s not really much of a dea— mmphh!”

She cuts you off with a glob of webbing over your lips.

“No, it’s not.  But I don’t negotiate with slaves.”  She picks you up and slings you over her shoulder.  “Now, show me to the site.  Otherwise, you’ll never see your friend here again.”

Revissa grunts helplessly into her gag, eyes fluttering nervously.  You meet her gaze and try to give her a comforting stare, but the truth is, Tula’s got you beat.  There’s nothing you wouldn’t surrender to her to ensure you weren’t separate from your wife.  

“So, let’s get going!” she says brightly, as she takes you back out of the cavern, leaving Revissa behind.

Okay… so this isn’t an ideal situation.  But at least you’ve introduced an element of randomness into the mix.  Maybe you’ll be able to come up with something that can get you out of this.

[[Get taken to the outpost-&gt;FE04]]

Someone who cares for her subordinates. Now, I’ve already met some of your, uh… associates, earlier in the forest.”

You think back to the pair of spider-women that attacked you on the cliffs, and how you barely managed to escape them by luring one into the territory of a ‘fearsome’ predator.

“And one of them, I know, is now missing.  I know where she is.”

Tula narrows her eyes.  “I heard about that.  What did you do to her?”

“Me?  Nothing.  But there’s a vicious monster in the heart of the woods, one with terrible psychic powers.  I just so happened to head in that direction when she was chasing me… and, well, she didn’t know what to expect.”

The spider-woman tugs your bound body into her arms, lifts you up, and presses you roughly against a wall.

“You’re going to lead me to her.”

You flash her a smile.

“Oh, of course, I would be happy to.  All I need in exchange is—”

But she cuts you off by slamming you again, hard.

“You misunderstand.  I don’t make deals with my slaves – and that’s what you are now.  There are two options before you.  One: you do as I command, and you live a comfortable life in my slave harem.  Two: you refuse, and I make you regret ever being born.  There’s no future here in which you have agency or ever go free.  All there is for you is compliant submission or torturous punishment.”

The ferocity in her eyes gives you pause.  Suddenly this negotiation route doesn’t seem as good of an idea as you thought it was.

“Well… that’s not really a very compelling set of choices,” you manage to sputter.

“Too bad.” 

She twitches one of her back legs and glues your mouth shut with more of her silk.  Then she scoops you up and tosses you over her shoulder once again.  As you squirm, you catch Revissa’s gaze, and the two of you exchange frightened looks - something that Tula quickly picks up on.

“You’re now going to lead me to where my sister is.  And if you don’t, I promise, you’ll never see your friend here again.”

Revissa makes a nervous grunt as Tula lustily squeezes one of her breasts, then heads out with you, leaving her behind.  Like it or not… it seems you’ve got to do as she says.

“Sweet and juicy, with a taste tha you can really get wrapped up in!” she says, flashing a ferocious smile at the camera.  “Ghost Fruits have changed my life!  But best of all is what they’ve done for my silk.”

She leans forward, waiting for the camera to get both you and herself in frame, before she gives the threads holding you in place a delicate twang.

“I’ve had this meal packaged up for three months, and it’s just as fresh as it was the day I caught it!”

Her hand reaches down, groping your breast, prompting you to moan helplessly into your gag, pitching and bucking your body violently at her touch.  But then–

“Cuuuut!”

The director hops down from her chair, pointing her megaphone irritably in your direction.

“This prop just isn’t working for me,” she says with a sigh.  “Can we swap it out for another one?”

Members of the stage crew get right on that, snipping away the silk tethering you to the ceiling and carrying you away.  You leave the set designed to look like a cavern, and emerge, for a moment, under the twilight sky of a planet you don’t know the name for, getting only a glimpse of stars before you’re brought to the trailer where the crew keeps their props.  Some two dozen cocooned women – all of them outfitted in ghost silk – look up as you’re brought in and glommed to the wall beside them, before the prop crew picks out another option to use for the shoot.

“Mmmmphh!” you yell weakly, as they settle on Revissa.

You and she can only exchange helpless glances before she’s taken away to replace you in the filming of the commercial.

In the end, you never did manage to get in contact with Azkumo through her ad agency.  But you did get Tula in touch with the right people to market her product.  Now “Ghost Fruits” are the hit of the Spider Queen world and she’s rolling in cash, having made quite a name for herself despite only being a “princess”.  And she was kind enough to get you and Revissa jobs modeling the silk spun from her product.

To her credit, it really does work quite well; you’re still bound up in the very same threads she used when she first caught you.  It’s never torn or frayed, staying taut and firm over your body for the many years you’ve been employed in your new profession.  And so long as it clings to you, you’re very low maintenance, not needing food, water, or medical treatment of any kind.  Which, of course, means you really are just a ‘prop’ to people using you in the films, not even a person.  And like the object that you are, when they finish filming (Revissa didn’t make the final cut either), you and the rest of the props are packed up tightly in a large crate and forgotten about, kept in storage until the next time you’re needed.

The film studio is quite fastidious with their props, never giving them even an inch of leeway.  

At least… they normally are.  But this time, for whatever reason, is different.  Because some time later you hear the sound of ships taking off through your crate, but you and your fellow props are left behind.  Some clueless stagehand must have forgotten to load you back into the cargo ship before they left, resulting in you all being abandoned on an otherwise uninhabited planet.  Sadly, this does not prove to be any kind of opportunity.  The silk remains firm, not decaying in the slightest, and your storage crate stays sturdy and strong, never letting you or the others see outside the darkness you’ve been trapped in.

No one ever comes back for you, and no one ever finds you.  The studio just writes it off as inventory loss and moves on, and Tula has long since forgotten about the cute pair she captured in the caverns of Spectra I all those years ago.

She cuts you free and carries you back to civilization, though it’s been over a decade since you were first snatched up.

It’s a short trip back to the Knottie outpost, made all the more shorter since you don’t need to walk there.  The spider lady is strong enough to carry you without breaking a sweat, and her silk remains firm, taut, and restrictive the entire time.  You’d hoped maybe you’d find some weakness or gap in your bindings on your way over, but try as you might, there’s nothing.  As much as you hate (but also are kind of happy) to admit, you’re completely and utterly helpless.  You aren’t going anywhere under your own power; she’s got you, and unless someone rescues you soon, she’s going to keep having you for as long as she wants you.

When she arrives, the spider lady takes a look at the accommodations, quickly realizing that the area is abandoned.  

“Well, it’s no space yacht, but it’s better than living in a cave,” she says with a grin.

After a quick search she locates the storage room of one of the living quarters, and strings you up against a support beam, nodding approvingly at the way you add to the ambience.

“That’ll do.  We’ve got plenty of food and equipment, but our little operation here has been lacking in… entertainment.”

She strokes your tail lovingly, savoring the softness of your fur, before turning to inspect the rest of the empty room.

“You and your friend aren’t enough.  We’re gonna need lots and lots of toys to keep morale up.  I don’t suppose you know where I can find any more, do you?”   She asks, as she reaches to pull off your gag.

Okay, this might be your chance.  Maybe you can use her desire for more slaves against her.  But is there anyone who you could tell her about that would be of any help?

Occasionally you’ll bonk your head on a tree branch or get your tail caught in some nettles, but she pays no mind to it, only looking back towards you every once in a while to demand you nod your head in the direction you should be going.

It’s not the easiest method of navigation, especially since she’s not letting you consult the map of the landscape you had on your comm device.  But luckily, that’s not too much of a problem.  Because you remember that the strange predator seemed to prowl in a large swath of space in the center of the forest.  You don’t need to be super accurate with your instructions, only close enough to lure her into the adorable monster’s psychic trap.  So you basically just wing it, trying to seem confident and knowledgeable despite the fact you’re making things up as you go along.

After a while, she does seem to catch on, and grows increasingly frustrated with you - snarling and growling whenever your directions manage to get her turned around.  But if she knew what you knew, it would be clear to her that this isn’t your fault.  Because the further in you get, the less navigation becomes possible.  Soon enough, she finds herself hopelessly lost.

That’s when the real trouble begins.  Just as she sets you down in annoyance and web-slings herself up onto a high branch to get her bearings, the wind seems to pick up.  Gently at first, but quickly increasing in intensity until it becomes a raging hurricane.  The gale-force winds knock her from her perch, sending her crashing back down to the ground with a heavy, painful-looking thump.  Of course, you know that the winds aren’t real - they’re just an illusion created to try to incapacitate her.  But there’s no reason that you need to tell her that.

“Is this the work of that predator?!” she growls.

“Mmmphh…” you say evasively.

With a groan of annoyance, she finally peels off your gag.

“Fine.  Tell me what this thing is, and how you beat it,” she demands.

Now’s your chance.  What can you tell her to help get yourself out of this situation?

And though it may not be ideal, telling Tula about them puts more pieces onto the game board - and surely one of your friends will have better luck against her than you did, right?

“I… came here with my crew,” you say slowly.  “Two went to the Knottie camp near the ruins to the east.  The other two are on our ship which is currently in orbit above the planet.  If you want more slaves, maybe pick a fight with them?”

Tula tilts her head in surprise.  “Oh?  Selling out your friends?  Well, don’t think that by betraying them I’m going to let you free in exchange or anything.  It just means I’ll be adding more slaves to my collection.”

“I’m not betraying anyo—” you begin, but don’t get to finish as she gloms some silk over your lips.

“Quiet, slave.  Now, come to think of it, I do recall you having a communicator on you while I was wrapping you up, right?  Shouldn’t be too hard to get in touch with these friends of yours and lure them into a trap.”  She strokes your tail affectionately.  “So let me just pick that up and I’ll be right back.”

And then she skitters out of the room, leaving you strung up and helpless.  You make some token efforts to struggle and squirm, but the silk holds tight, and you make absolutely no progress by the time she shuffles back.  (if: $revissacaught is true)[](else: )[Revissa is slung over her shoulder, and gets tethered up in place beside you with more lines of silk.  

“I picked up another package along the way,” Tula says, giving Revissa’s butt a lusty squeeze.

You and she exchange nervous glances, both disappointed that the other hadn’t found some way to escape since you last saw each other.  Both of you can do nothing but writhe, watching impotently as the spider woman fishes around for something in a bag.]

“Well, I found it,” Tula says brightly, holding up your communicator and fiddling with the buttons.  You mentally kick yourself for not ever putting any kind of password protection on it.  “So, let’s send some messages to those friends of yours and lure them into my larder.”

Your heart sinks in your chest.  When you mentioned your crew, you were kind of expecting her to try taking all of them on at once in a fair fight.  But if she’s being crafty about it… this might prove to be a problem.  But… they have what it takes to get out of this… right?

Right?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="391" name="FE04B" tags="" position="1725,2800" size="100,100">You think for a moment, and decide on a solution that might get you out of this mess.  Last time you were here, you were nearly captured by a lusty (and busty) flower woman.  There’s no reason to assume that Petal isn’t still around here, lurking, waiting.  Between her pollen, her powerful vines, and her influence over the local flora, surely she’d be a match for a single spider?

At least, that’s what you hope.

“There’s a woman around here,” you say.  “Actually, she’s the reason there’s all those hunks of amber littering the ground outside.  She’s a gorgeous plant lady who protects the forest by trapping people with her nectar.  If you’re planning on living here, you’d probably end up meeting her anyway, so if I were you I’d — mmmphh!”

Tula shuts you up with a glob of webbing over your lips.

“You’re not me, so don’t tell me what to do, slave.  But that *is* some interesting intel… I’ve never owned a plant before, so it’ll be a learning experience for sure.  But a fun one!”

She flicks your ear playfully, waving goodbye as she heads out to make her catch.(if: $revissacaught is true and $petalfriend is true)[

As she goes, you exchange glances with Revissa.  Though you can’t speak directly (you lost the gag-talk translator when Tula wrapped you up), you can still communicate some basic ideas with grunts and eyebrow waggles.  With her connection to the forest, maybe she could somehow send a warning to Petal to let her know there’s a spider coming for her?

Revissa considers a moment, but then shakes her head.  She tries to explain something to you, but it’s too complex of an idea for you to parse just from muffled grunts and groans. (if: $roscaught is true)[However, Ros’eela, strung up beside you, is naturally fluent in gag-speak, and appears to figure it out.  The pink-skinned Knottie wriggles and shakes her body, twisting it enough that she’s able to use her head tendrils to gather up a bit of moss and leaves from an overhead rafter.  Then she swings and deposits the plant matter between Revissa’s breasts.  Your wife rolls her eyes, but then nods her head that this is good enough.

It’s at this point you realize what’s going on.  To communicate with the forest, Revissa needs to be in physical contact with some kind of plant life.  Without it, she can’t do the ritual.  So hopefully now she’ll be able to get that warning out in time.(set: $tulaamber to true)](else: )[Sadly, with no idea what she’s saying, you’ll just have to hang here and hope that Petal will be able to handle the spider.]]

Now all that’s left to do is wait and see what happens next.

And then you remember that last you saw her, Ros’eela was here at the camp in the parked cargo ship.  Maybe if you point the spider in her direction, the bondage-capable Knottie will be able to turn the tables on the devious arachnid.

“Actually… there’s someone still here at this camp,” you say.  “All the other Knotties were taken out, but one was still active.  She’s somewhere in the cargo ship in the middle of the clearing.”

Tula considers this.  “Hrmm… I was planning on avoiding the ship since it surely has traps and security droids… but the prospect of another cutie in my clutches is too tantalizing to resist.  I’ll be right back!”

And then she leaves, though not before gluing your lips shut again.  Once she’s gone, you hold on to a vain hope that Ros’eela might be able to escape her clutches.  After all, she’s an expert in bondage - both giving it and taking it.  Surely a single spider lady isn’t enough to stop her talents?  Unfortunately, you find your hopes dashed a few minutes later when your captor returns.

“I must say, she put up a surprisingly good fight!  But in the end, silk beats leather, I suppose.”

You spare a look for your pink-skinned friend.  Her body is completely slathered in webbing, hugging her frame with impossible tightness, save for her face, head tendrils, and breasts.  The spider woman wastes no time adhering her to the ceiling next to you,happily increasing the size of her collection.  Noticing that her tendrils are not restrained, you think that, perhaps, they could be an avenue for her to unbind herself, but when you make eye contact with her Ros’eela seems to read your expression and shakes her head sadly to the negative.  As an expert in bondage, she has an intrinsic sense of when she’s totally beaten, and it seems like that is the case here.  She’s not getting free, and neither are you.

Well, crap.  All you managed to do is get one of your friends kidnapped.  Though… Ros’eela does seem to be enjoying herself, squirming and straining against the webs and moving herself in such a way as to stimulate her body.  Good on her.  Though this doesn’t solve the question of how you’re getting out of here.

“Got any more cuties for me?” Tula asks, as she idly strokes the length of Ros’eela’s head tendril.

“Mmmph,” you say grumpily.

“Oh, right.”  One of her back legs extends to peel off your gag.  “Well?”

You are again faced with a question of what to tell her.

She’s strong, fast, and highly capable with her webbing, able to reduce even someone as strong as you are into a cocooned, mewling captive.  What could you say to her that might get the tables turned?

And that’s when you remember the woman you encountered in the center of the woods.  She was some kind of fae entity, taking the form of a gorgeous elvaan named Skadi, though she was just pulling that image from your mind.  You’re not entirely sure what the fae woman is truly capable of, but you’re pretty sure her magic is powerful enough to defeat Tula with ease.

“Well… I met this one woman,” you say.  “Deep in the heart of the woods, between the cliffs and the river.  She was some kind of powerful, tricksy fae.”

“Was she cute?” Tula asks eagerly.  

“Oh, for sure.  Though I think she takes on a different appearance depending on who is looking at her.  So when you catch her, she’ll look like whatever your heart desires.”

“She sounds fun!” Tula says.  She hops excitedly towards the door, but not before slinging a bit of silk to glue your lips back together.

And then you wait.  It takes the better part of an hour, but eventually the spider woman returns… and she has a wriggling cocoon slung over her shoulder.  Is it possible?!  Did she somehow manage to outwit the fae?  You can’t believe it!

But when she strings up her catch, you find that it’s not the fae woman at all… but your wife.  Revissa looks dazed and disoriented when she gets strapped up beside you, only coming too once she’s been thoroughly anchored in place.  You and she exchange glances, but it’s clear she’s just as helpless as she was before.

“Kinda disappointing…” Tula says.  “You said she takes the form of my deepest desire, but she just looks like a cutie I’ve already caught.  Though I guess it’s a wash, since the original cutie seems to have escaped somehow…”

You blink in confusion.  Why is she saying that?  Unless… she actually *did* encounter the fae woman and was somehow tricked or charmed into believing something else.

“You guessed it!” says a breathy voice right beside your ear.

Turning your head, you see the fae woman herself standing beside you.  Though Tula doesn’t seem to notice her.

“It was a good effort,” she says, gently prodding your cheek.  “And obviously I *could* have just turned her into an action figure or something.  But… I couldn’t just let you get what you wanted, could I?  It can’t ever be that easy for you.  So now your new spider mistress is just a bit confused, but she’ll take good care of her slaves all the same.”

“Mmmphh!” you say.  You no longer have the gag-talk translator on you, but she seems to understand your meaning all the same.

“Hmm?  Play a game with me for a chance to win your freedom?”  She tilts her head to the side.  “Nah.  Helpless spider sex toy is a pretty good Bad End for you.  Maybe if you bumped into me when you weren’t already caught, I’d consider it.  There’s a path for that somewhere.  But not here.  So… bye!”

And then she vanishes, leaving you and Revissa helplessly trussed up in Tula’s care.  It looks like your brilliant plan was a bust.  Now what?

You feel Tula pull away your gag, as she idly plays with Revissa’s long hair braid.

“Well?  Any more cuties you can think of for me to catch?”

It seems like you’re again faced with a choice.

But at the same time, you don’t want to sic this gorgeous arachnid on anyone else.  Maybe the best thing to do is to send her on a wild goose chase.  That way, if she’s gone long enough, you might have the opportunity to escape all on your own.

“Well… there is someone…” you say, trying your best to make your voice sound believable.  “But… I’m not sure you’d be interested…”

Tula narrows her eyes.  “Don’t play coy with me, slave.  If it’s a cute girl, of *course* I’ll want to catch her.”

You quickly start to concoct a story in your head.  “Yes, well, this particular cutie might be too much, even for you.  See, we bumped into her while wandering the forest.  She was, uh… a short and feisty Usami - probably no more than four feet tall.  But what the little bunny lacked in size, she more than made up for in power.  She carried around a hammer, and was using it to hunt down giant spiders and bop them on the head, forcing them to submit and acknowledge she was the top of the food chain.”

“Giant spiders?” Tula says, raising an eyebrow.  “I wasn’t aware there were any of those in this particular forest. Though I saw plenty of small ones…”

Yes, good, that’s what you were hoping she would say.  “Tula, level with me,” you say evenly.  “Have you ever been to any forest, on any planet, anywhere in the galaxy, that wasn’t home to any giant spiders?”

She considers this for a moment.  “Good point.  As far as I know, it’s ecologically impossible for a forest to appear in this universe and for it to *not* eventually produce giant spiders.”

You’ve had that very same experience.  “Sometimes you really have to look for them, but they’re always there.  Lurking.  *Waiting*.”

“Hrmm… and you say this tiny bunny woman was *hunting* them?”

“Yup.  She was able to take most of them out in a single bonk.  Really saved my bacon, because I was caught and cocooned almost instantly when they showed up.”

Tula nods her head.  “Yeah, you have the look of a woman who always gets caught by spiders.”

Ain’t that the truth.

“Alright,” Tula continues, “I’ll catch this Usami of yours.  Show her that there’s always a bigger and better spider.  Where did you run into her?”(if: $basiliskmet is true)[

You think for a moment… and then an idea occurs to you.  During your trek through the forest, you’d happened to run across the lair of a basilisk, and only through pure luck were you able to walk away from the encounter.  But if Tula went there alone, unaware and without backup…

“So it actually wasn’t *too* far from the fruit orchard,” you say, and begin to describe the area as best as you can remember.](else: )[Based on your memory of the layout of the forest, you give her some coordinates that are about as far away as possible from where you are now.  She seems annoyed at the distance, but appears to have completely bought your story otherwise.  And the prospect of capturing a tiny spider-bopping Usami is too tantalizing to pass up for her.]

Once she’s memorized the location, Tula slaps another web gag over your lips, and heads towards the door.

“I’ll be back soon!” she promises, then skitters off into the forest.

She whistles happily to herself as she uses some more tethers to string up her, right next  to where you’re hanging.  You and your wife exchange nervous glances, both of you disappointed that the other was not able to concoct some plan to escape.]

After some aimless bustling around the room, checking various corners and inspecting the supply crates left behind, Tula pulls out a communicator and sends a quick message.

“I’ve let the girls know to come on down to enjoy their new toys.”  She gives your ear a gentle stroke.  “I think they’re going to like what I’ve prepared for them.”

When she returns, she has Lumina in tow.  The gorgeous angel is no less helpless than Krysta was - if anything, she’s even more trussed up.  Her beautiful wings are completely shrouded in silk, packaged up so completely that not even a single feather is left exposed to the air.

“A couple of cryptic text messages lured them out from the Knottie camp,” Tula explains.  “I might be good, but a whole colony of Knotties is probably too much to handle even for me.  Though once I get more recruits of my own it shouldn’t be too hard to take them out.”

As Lumina and Krysta struggle and squirm, you hear the sound of a ship outside, setting down in the open space of the clearing the outpost was built on.

“Ah, and that will be the other two,” Tula says happily.  “Right on time.  Be right back, cuties!”

Vhaja is wrapped up almost identically, strapped up right beside her partner.

Did Tula figure out how to capitalize on that?  If she’d sprayed your friends with the stuff, it’s no surprise it was so easy to take care of them.  For magic users like Vhaja and Jyumon, a fight is often determined in the first few seconds, in the speed it takes to react and prepare the perfect spell for the situation.  If they were taken unawares, then they would have had no chance against Tula.

Whatever the case, it’s clear now that you and your entire crew are all completely at her mercy.  At this point, it seems like you’re completely out of luck.

And you’re not the only one subjected to this indignity.

Revissa is never far away, webbed up right beside you, equally caught and defeated.  It’s somehow both depressing and comforting, knowing that you’re in this together.  On the one hand, if you had a choice of it, of course you’d wish her to have her freedom.  But given that she doesn’t, at least you have each other’s company to help soften the impact of your captivity.  Every once in a while, during a rare gap when you’re not being played with, the two of you will exchange glances, look into each other’s eyes and try to share a moment of mutual understanding.  You love your wife with your whole heart.  And even here, in the most hopeless of circumstances, you find comfort in her presence.(if: $crewcaught is true)[  

The rest of your crew suffers in similar ways.  They’re strung up close by, their bodies on display for any who want them.  It pains you to watch them succumb to the endless advances of their captors, how their strength and resolve fails them in the face of the harsh reality of their fate.  Krysta protests at first, squirming and thrashing defiantly, but eventually she gives in, making the most of the pleasurable touch of silk on her body, and of the curvaceous figures of the women who avail themselves to her.  Lumina holds out for a long time, trying to put on a brave face in response to her plight, but after a few weeks her composure crumbles and she melts into a heavenly chorus of compliant coos as the spiders have their fun at her expense.  Jyumon resigns herself to the situation after a while, frequently closing her eyes and retreating into her mind as her body becomes a playground for her new owners.  Vhaja is the only one who never fully gives in, her eyes always desperately searching for some solution, some opening that she can capitalize on - though that chance never seems to come.](if: $roscaught is true)[

Ros’eela is a fan favorite as well.  She is the only one who seems to be actively enjoying herself, who willingly sways her cocooned body to the tune of spider’s lusty song.  Her head tendrils prove to be particularly popular, especially when the tip of them finds their way between the slick folds of her owner’s lower lips.  As someone trained in the art of both domination and submissiveness, she knows when and how to surrender, and soon she’s fully acclimated to the reality of her situation.](if: $petalcaught is true)[

It takes some remodeling, but eventually Petal is transported to the storage room as well.  Parts of the floor are removed to give access to the fertile soil beneath the building, so that the captive plant girl can dig her roots in to keep herself nourished.  A sun roof is built in the ceiling, and research is done to provide her with all the proper nutrients and accommodations she needs to stay healthy.  The spiders do an impressive job of it, ensuring that her body flourishes even while she’s so hopelessly bundled up, and before long that heavenly scent of nectar and pollen fills the room.  Thanks to that, what remaining resistance you and the other slaves had left in them quickly melts away, turning everyone into little more than vessels of endless lust, bodies screaming from the embrace of their owners.](if: $faecaught is true)[

The cocooned fae is here too.  Despite all her incredible power, it seems that the promise she made after you won the coin toss remains binding.  She’s as helpless as you are – and you are, quite decidedly, utterly helpless.  That makes her a popular target for the spiders, since each of them perceives her differently, but always what they see is the ideal form of sylvan beauty.  You take some small comfort in the fact that even more so than you, her body is in the highest demand among the slavers.  You might not be able to escape, but at least means she won’t either.]

Over the next several months, the outpost’s population grows - both in numbers of spider women, and in the number of slaves on hand to entertain them.  A day never goes by without you having at least one resident making use of you, and most days it’s more than that.  Eventually it falls into a routine, making you start to forget you ever had a life outside of this.  Though every once in a while, you’ll wonder what could possibly happen that would produce a change in your situation.

With your body bundled up in silk, there’s really not much you can do *other* than wait.  Every once in a while you exchange glances with your fellow captives, wondering what fate has in store for you.  But other than that, it’s really kind of boring.  At least… until the smell of pollen wafts in.

You know that smell.  That sweet, indescribable smell.  You faced it not that long ago, the cloying scent that drove you mad while you explored the outpost here.  Already, you can feel your pulse starting to rise, your libido kicking into overdrive, the sensations on your skin magnified as every nerve ending yearns for stimulation.  

Everything else fades away, and you begin to wriggle and writhe, to strain and struggle, to desperately try to find some way to bring yourself the pleasure you seek.  This webbing might be delightfully snug, but it’s clear it was woven with the intent for someone else to play with you - not for you to play with yourself.  And so you find yourself overwhelmed with desire, frustrated with helplessness, unable to provide that last bit of pressure needed to send you over the edge.

“Mmmphh… mmmph!” you yell, locking eyes with Ros’eela, who appears to be in a similar state.  Her head tendrils aren’t long enough to reach her crotch, and her suspended position means she has no way to maneuver herself that will allow her to grind against anything.  Being captured was bad enough, but this is just plain torture!

At least, it is until some helpful vine tendrils creep in through the door and wrap themselves around your bodies.  They press themselves between your legs, insert themselves right where they are needed to bring you the release you so desire.  What follows is the most overwhelming orgasm of your life, so mind-numbing you lose all sense of awareness for several long minutes, completely subsumed by the pleasure you’ve finally been granted.  Which is why you don’t notice that Revissa is cut down long before either of you are.

When you finally come to your senses, you find her standing over you, holding the rune-imbued knife Vhaja entrusted to you in her hand.

“What… what happened?” you murmur in your post-coital haze.

“Petal came to our rescue, just like we hoped she would,” Revissa explains.  “Thanks to my warning she knew what was coming, and she was prepared to defend herself.”

Though still in a dreamy haze, your befuddled mind starts to connect the dots.  If Petal successfully defended herself, then that means Tula is…

“See for yourself,” Revissa says, reading the expression on your face.  You follow her outside, and are stunned to find that your spider problem has been taken care of.

Tula looks like she was about to put up a fight, her legs all spread out around her, the expression on her face combative and defiant.  But that didn’t do her much good.  Petal caught her all the same, perhaps capitalizing on how disoriented she must have been from the pollen.  Her naked body glistens beneath the honey-colored amber, Tula’s naked figure openly exposed yet hopelessly cut off from any external contact.

“Well, did I do good?” comes a sugar-sweet voice from behind her.

Leaves unfurl and Petal appears within her flower, looking every bit as chipper as she did when last you met.  It seems that making friends with her really paid off!  

“Yeah… more than good.  I’m sure this lady was going to cause more problems for the forest,” you say.  “But now she’s just a lovely paperweight.”  You meet eyes with the bewitching flower woman and smile.  “How can we ever repay you for saving us?”

She chuckles.  “Well… I can think of one way.  You all got to have some fun with my vines before… but I couldn’t exactly go into the building to join you.”

Those very same vines curl around you now, already in the process of lifting you, Revissa, and Ros’eela up into the air.  All of you exchange glances, then nod in agreement.  There’s no reason in the world not to go for a second round of stimulation.  It’s only fair, after all.

“You were right!  There really was a sexy plant gal lurking around.  Thanks for the tip!”

She gives you a thumbs-up, before pulling out a data device and queuing up a holo-pic of a scene out in the forest.

You can hardly believe it, but it’s true.  As terrifying as Petal was, it looks like Tula was able to completely defeat her.  Her body is bundled up in silk, her generous bosom uncovered with the modesty leaves she used to have there, and her lower plant-like body is gunked up with webbing.  It’s probably restrictive enough that she can no longer fold her fronds over her body to hide her feminine figure, which, you guess, would prevent her from traveling underground to other parts of the forest as well.

“Yup!  Now she’s all mine.  Gotta say, that pollen of hers was really effective!” Tula says, tapping her device to rotate the image to show the captive plant woman from all sides.  “It’s a good thing I get even better at wrapping up cuties when I’m horny.”

Your heart sinks in your chest.  Petal was one of your best chances at getting out of this.  *Now* how are you going to escape?

“So, anyway, I figure later on we’ll dig up some of the floor here in the storage room and put in a patch of dirt so that she can dig her roots into something.  And then she’ll get to hang out with all the other slaves.  I bet that pollen of hers will keep you all nice and happy when it’s play time, yeah?”

She reaches out and cups your exposed breast, making you grunt weakly in arousal.

“But for now, we still need more cuties.  Got any more suggestions?”

A flick of her finger peels off your gag once more.  Dare you risk subjecting anyone else to her predations?

Your memory of the experience is hazy, just a confusing rush of sensations, of vines tightened around your skin, of sweet nectar on your tongue, of Petal’s soft breasts squishing against your face, of her lips on your sex.  If she had evil intent, there’s no question that the three of you would have been completely dominated by her, helpless to resist her plans.  But luckily, once she’s fully satisfied, she lets you all go, dropping you down to the forest floor panting and exhausted.

“Thank you!” she says, spreading a little bit more pollen to keep you in a dreamy daze just a while longer.  “Hopefully if I get any more visitors, they’ll be fun ones like you, and not mean ones like her.”

She slaps Tula’s amber prison with a vine.

“I don’t want any of her life energy seeping into my forest, so you can take her,” she says, making a nasty face towards the frozen spider.

You’re too tired to give any response other than a weary thumbs-up.  Then you pass out, drifting to sleep and the comfort of even more lusty dreams.  When you wake up, Petal is gone, but your nectar-encased trophy is still here for you to take back to the landing site at your leisure.  You blow a kiss at Tula brightly, then trek back to where she first caught you to retrieve the equipment she stripped from you.  By the time you return, Revissa and Ros’eela are awake, so the three of you get dressed back up and part ways on good terms.

“Pity she’s stuck in there,” Ros’eela says about Tula when you’re ready to leave.  “Her silk would have been good for more training.”

“Training?!  You were helpless!” Revissa groans.

“Sometimes being helpless is the best kind of training,” you say, earning a high five from the knottie and a roll of the eyes from your wife.  

As before, Ros’eela promises to offer any help on your mission that she can if you need her, then returns to the outpost to tend to her amber-encased co-workers.  And so, with everything else taken care of, Revissa rigs up some vines to help you drag your prisoner away, and together you prepare to leave the forest.(if: $faecaught is true)[

Though as you leave, you spare one last glance behind you, and remember that the fae woman had been wrapped up in the building with you after you were caught.  At some point during all the fun, she must have escaped.  You suppose it makes sense.  The rule you set was that you were both equally helpless while cocooned, so since you ended up being saved it&#39;s only &#39;fair&#39; that she has the same luck.

Which means that somewhere out there, the gorgeous fae still lurks.  It would have been nice to have been rid of her for good, but it looks like she’s given you the slip for now.  Hopefully this will be the last you see of her, though you’re pretty sure you won’t be that lucky.]

You hang there in your tight silk cocoon and you wait, praying that Tula runs into that basilisk on her expedition.

An hour passes, and then another.  You try to pass the time by struggling and straining against your bindings, but it’s clear to you that you’re completely unable to escape on your own.  Which raises another issue in your mind - even if your plan does work perfectly, how the heck are you going to get out of here if Tula never comes back?  Even if you had a hundred years, you don’t think this webbing would ever budge an inch.  

With nothing else to do, you take a moment to look around the room.  Revissa meets your gaze, and from the look in her eyes you can tell she shares your anxiety.  You’ve been through countless adventures together - but this might very well be the last if you don’t figure out some way to untangle yourself.(if: $roscaught is true)[  Ros’eela hangs not far from your wife, snugly secure in her silken bindings.

It’s hard for you to believe she could have been overpowered in the first place, but it seems Tula really is just that skilled with her webwork.](if: $rosawake is true and $roscaught is false and $petalcaught is true)[

It takes nearly a day before rescue arrives, but at least it does come.  Just as you start to resign yourself to the fact that you’re going to be abandoned forever, Ros’eela sticks her pink head through the door and looks up towards your cocooned body.

“Huh, somehow I thought I might find you hanging out around here,” she says with a grin, taking a moment to admire the intricate webwork that went into your restraints.  “The cocooned plant cutie outside was kind of a dead giveaway.”

You breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that rescue is finally at hand.  And now that you can relax… you can actually spend a moment to appreciate the tautness of your restraints, the soft kiss of the silk, the way it so expertly hugs your every curve.  It’s all quite… exhilarating.  Maybe some of Petal’s pollen has wafted in through the door, because you’re suddenly too horny to think straight. Ros’eela notices it straight away, and gives you a knowing wink.

“I’ll just cut down the missus first then, yeah?”

All you can manage is a nod before you close your eyes and give in to the sensations washing over you.

[[Have some fun-&gt;FE04EC]]](else: )[

In the end, rescue never comes.  Instead, it’s just more spider-babes.  Maybe two days after your original capture they finally discover you, and from their chatter you piece together that Tula has gone missing.  On the bright side, it looks like that means your plan worked as intended and she’s probably been reduced to a hunk of inert stone somewhere in the woods, likely never to be found.  The problem is that it does you little good, as you’re still bundled up and completely at the mercy of the gorgeous arachnids.  And they definitely take advantage of that fact.  

Sadly, despite all your best efforts, it looks like you’re still not going to be anything other than a wrapped up plaything.

So, you wiggle and squirm.  You grunt and strain, you pitch and buck your body as much as you can.  But the webbing remains taut and resolute, not budging even an inch.  Well, no matter.  Then you’ll just have to struggle so hard you break the rafter you’ve been glued to!  So you redouble your efforts.  You work your muscles as far as they will go, trying to use one layer of silk as leverage to lean against, pushing back onto it in order to apply more pressure to a different set of strands.  

Maybe, with weeks of effort, you could have made a difference.  After the first hour, you’re pretty sure you heard a creak, after all.  With enough time, perhaps you could have completely pulled down the support beam.  Anything is possible if you set your mind to it.  

Well… anything, other than escaping from a lusty spider-babe.

When Tula comes back, she finds you completely covered in sweat, panting and exhausted – and finds not a single tear in your bindings, nor even the smallest of dents in the ceiling.  All that work for absolutely no gain.

“Looks like you’ve been busy,” she says, giving your tail a playful stroke.  “And so have I.  And also like you, I have nothing to show for my efforts.”(if: $revissacaught is true)[](else: )[She glances back towards the door.  “Well, not *completely* nothing.  I did swing back by the cave on my way here.”

Her wrist flicks, pulling in a well-wrapped bundle that she’d laid down just outside – Revissa.  As she strings your wife up onto the ceiling beside you, the two of you can only exchange nervous glances.  It seems like neither of you managed to come up with any sort of escape plan while you were separated.

Once she’s done, she takes a step back, but then seems to remember how annoyed she was at something.]

She narrows her eyes at you.  “I’m starting to think you might have been lying about that hammer-wielding Usami, slave.  It *did* sound too fantastical to be true.  Imagine it, a spider afraid of an angry bunny.  You really had me going there for a while.”

With a few twitches of her back legs, she creates a hammock of silk for her to fall backwards onto to relax.  Another tug, and the webbing you had no way to sever somehow unfurls at her command, releasing you so that you can drop into her waiting arms.

“Anyway, I’m beat.  So you’re gonna be my cuddle pillow while I rest up.  And then once we’re done, I’m gonna call the rest of the girls down here and we can have fun with our new toys.”

Her human arms wrap around you, holding you tight.  And then her spider legs bend over as well, slathering tethers all over your body to make sure you don’t try to struggle free while you’re being snuggled.

Any way you look at it, it seems like you’re completely screwed.  So now all you can do is wait and see what else your new owner has in store for you.

As the river comes into view, you scoop Revissa up into your arms, allowing her to do the druidic hand motions for her shapeshifting magic without needing to set foot on the ground.  An important thing to consider, as her legs start to meld together, forming themselves instead into a long, scaly, mermaid-like tail.

When you reach the edge of the stream you toss your now-aquatic wife in, then look backwards one last time to give the pursuing spider lady a taunting smile.  After that you close your eyes, lean backwards, and tip yourself into the water as well.  You hold your breath for a moment as you submerge, opening your eyes back up to get a look at what your wife has become.

Her transformation has given her flippers and tail, a sleek body capable of sliding through the water with speed and grace.

You smile at her as the current starts to pull you backwards, relaxing as she swims over and wraps her arms around you.  When she draws you into a kiss, you feel bubbles spill out from her lips, washing down your throat and filling your lungs with air through druidic magic.  With this, you’ll be able to breathe as well as she can.

And that means there’s not much to worry about as you make your escape.  Revissa holds you tight against her chest as her powerful tail flicks against the water, pulling you both downstream along with the current, heading towards safety.

You’re both running as fast as you can, but despite your head start, you can see through the corner of your eye the shadow advancing towards you along the treetops, slinging between branches on expertly aimed lines of webbing.  It’s only a matter of time before she catches up.  No, not even that - she’s so confident she doesn’t even think she *needs* to catch up.  It’s not a bad thought on her part.  Web-slinging is less tiring than running full tilt, so eventually you’ll both be too exhausted to continue.  But she doesn’t know what you do.

When you reach an open stretch of grass, Revissa casts the spell.  She raises her staff, mutters a few druidic incantations, and wreathes herself in the flow of nature energy around her.

Revissa nods, and waits for you to create a distraction by slashing the wall of soil apart with your sword.  The spider lady is buffeted by a cloud of dirt and dust, disorienting her for just long enough for the two of you to make your exit.  

It’s a short distance from here to the cliffs.  The rocky barrier cradles the west side of the forest, high enough to be visible from nearly any spot inside that wasn’t totally blocked by foliage.  That makes it easy to head that way and impossible to get lost, though it also poses a problem for your attempts at escape - one you are sure the pursuing spider lady is well aware of.  After all, the high wall of stone would need to be carefully scaled, navigated with caution and diligence, and climbed with only two arms and two legs.  Slow going for you, but simple for a woman whose many spindly appendages can poke into all those little cracks and gaps.  She probably thinks the two of you are fools, heading in a direction that would give her the advantage.

But you have a plan.  Or, well, Revissa does.  Looking behind you, you can see that the spider lady is taking her time, keeping her distance, letting you run towards the sheer wall of rock that will block you in once you reach it.  But she doesn’t know what your wife is capable of.  Because once you get far enough away, Revissa begins to channel her shapeshiting magic, sprouting feathers from her arms as she spreads them wide, growing sharp talons from her feet as her clothing melds into her body.

In her harpy form, she can glide through the air with ease, and is even just barely strong enough to take a single passenger along for the ride.  You allow her to clamp her talons around your shoulders, pressing in tightly (and slightly painfully) before she lifts up into the air.  You hear muffled curses of surprise from the woman who now stands below you, and you turn to see her skittering up onto the tallest tree she can find to try and line up a shot with her silk as you flee.  

You’re not gonna let her get the chance, though.  Pulling out your blaster pistol from its holster, you aim a few shots down towards her, not trying to hit her, just attempting to lay down covering fire that will keep her occupied for long enough that Revissa can escape the range of her webbing.  The gambit works, and you feel the wind whip up around you as you sail towards the cliffs, free from the woman’s pursuit.  Though just before she becomes a speck amongst the trees, you do see her reaching for what looks like a communicator…

Who might she be calling?  (if: $FBStart is true)[Thinking back on it, you recall your encounter with the other two spider-legged women who attacked you while you were traveling through the cliffs.  It stands to reason they’re connected.  Maybe it would be safer to alter your course and try a different route.](else: )[You can’t be sure, but hopefully whoever it is won’t be able to arrive until you’ve escaped the forest entirely.]

And though Revissa moves at a rapid clip through the water, you nonetheless find the trip refreshing, held tightly in your wife’s arms.  While you may talk a big game, the truth of the matter is that all you really bring to the table in your partnership is a winning smile, brash confidence, and some amazing muscles.  Yet Revissa has an endless array of magic to draw from, allowing her to transform her body into wondrous shapes and command the impressive strength of nature to lend its aid.  Compared to that, having decent aim with a blaster or being able to heft a heavy sword around hardly seems worth the trouble.  It doesn’t bother you too much, though.  In times like this, it’s actually nice to know that, despite your pretenses about being a famous space adventurer, someone wonderful and amazing and far more capable than you’ll ever be has your back.

So as she swims, you nestle your face against her chest and mouth “I love you” into the water, the words muffled by the flow of bubbles that escape your lips.

After you’ve gone far enough, Revissa finally breaches the surface of the water, and you find yourselves nearly at the edge of the woods.  Despite her speed and persistence, there’s simply no way that spider lady could have kept up with you for this long, especially as the trees started to thin out the farther you got from the forest’s center.  

“That was some mighty fine swimming,” you say, pulling yourself up onto the shore.  Revissa sort of dolphin-leaps up to follow you, landing with a wet flop on the ground nearby.  You chuckle as her fish tail slaps uselessly on the floor while she does the motions to change herself back to her normal humanoid shape.(if: $faecaught is true)[

“I can’t believe that worked,” she says, doing some stretches to reacquaint herself with how legs work.  “Both the escape plan, and what you did to that annoying fae.”

You grin proudly.  “Yeah, I can be pretty clever sometimes, can’t I?”

“Clever?  More like useless.  And also hopelessly perverted, especially when it comes to spider bondage.  But I guess when you force that uselessness onto someone else it almost turns into a talent, if you squint hard enough.  I’m just surprised you chose to run.  I was half-expecting you to surrender on the spot so you could join that fae in her plight.](else: )[

“I’m just surprised you chose to run,” she says, doing some stretches to reacquaint herself with how legs work.  “I half-expected you to surrender to that spider woman as soon as she appeared.”]

“I mean, I was definitely considering it,” you say with a grin.  “Maybe the temptation wouldn’t be so high if you’d get around to learning how to shapeshift into a spider hybrid.”

Revissa can turn herself into many shapes, up to and including a full-on giant spider, but transformations like the mermaid form she just employed are not as easy as they appear and take a lot of training to get right.  As much as you love the feel of her silk when she becomes a big scary arachnid, you’d love it even more if she were able to look more like the hottie who had just chased you through the forest.

“If you’re good, maybe I’ll figure it out as a Wintermas present for you this year,” she says with a sigh.

“Oooh, and then you can gift-wrap me for the occasion!” you say with an eager grin.

“Don’t think that gets you out of *actually* buying me something, though,” your wife counters.  “Tying yourself up in ribbons and laying in a box stops being cute after you do it three years in a row.  Especially when you *know* I’ve been wanting new trellises for the cargo-bay garden…”

You make a mental note to earmark some funds for that after the payout for this mission, as the two of you head back to the forest entrance in delightfully high spirits.

[[Exit the forest-&gt;FE07]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="409" name="FE06AA" tags="" position="3675,2825" size="100,100">You continue on for quite some time through the river, making good progress towards the entrance, and what you hope is the relative safety of the open fields outside the forest.  But as you move with the flow, you remember something.  The river goes past the Knottie outpost you encountered earlier in your quest.  And last you checked, Ros’eela was still there.  It would be wrong to just leave her, especially with this spider lady prowling the area.    {Sure, she’s frozen and mounted on a wall at the moment, but that just means she wouldn’t even be able to fend for herself if the arachnid predator decided she’d like better hanging from *her* wall, instead.}  No matter how you slice it, you decide the right thing to do would be to head back there.

And so you give Revissa a tug on her fin and point towards the surface of the water, indicating you’d like to pop back up to have a chat.

“What’s wrong?” she asks, her mermaid face bobbing above the water.  Luckily, the magic that transformed her makes her equally adept at breathing in air as she is in water while in this shape.

“We should check in on the outpost again,” you say.  “It’s not fair to leave Ros’eela behind while there’s a predator wandering the area.”

Revissa sighs, but eventually nods her head in agreement.  “Alright.  Help me out onto the shore and I’ll change back.”

One downside to her mermaid form is that it’s not particularly convenient for her to revert to a humanoid while underwater; suddenly losing gills in the middle of doing magic can be very disorienting, not to mention a drowning hazard.  So you climb out first, then offer a hand to your wife to remove her from the river.  But something else snags her before you do.

“Gotcha!” says a voice from above.

A line of silk slaps into Revissa’s back the moment it’s exposed, glomming on tightly enough to form a tether to allow the unseen fisherwoman to yank backwards and reel her in.  You look up just in time to see that same gorgeous spider woman lurking atop a rocky cliff overlooking the river, now with a squirming mermaid thrashing in her arms.

(set: $picF114 to true)

“Hook, line, and sinker,” she says blithely, swiftly reducing your wife to a helpless, fishy bundle.  A single one of her spindly back legs is enough to carry her weight, allowing Revissa to be suspended upside down in a tight, inescapable cocoon.  “It was easy enough to follow your shadows beneath the water - and I knew you’d have to surface eventually.”

A mixture of panic and rage builds up within your chest.  “Let her go!” you snarl, reaching for the blaster pistol you keep at your hip.

“Hrmmm…” says the beautiful arachnid, tilting her head to the side.  “Nah!”

And then several more sticky stands launch from the tips of her legs.  They catch you on the wrists, the ankles, and the waist, preventing you from reaching your weapon.  And then one final, thick glob strikes you on the chest with enough force to send you careening backwards, away from the riverside and into the shade of the trees.

On the one hand, you feel vindicated.  Like you expected, this lady was strong enough, fast enough, and accurate enough to capture both of you instantly.  Running away was definitely the right call.  But on the other hand… you confirmed that by *getting* captured.  That fact is already a foregone conclusion, despite your fervent efforts to strain against the webbing holding you down.

The woman leaps down with lazy grace, taking the time to suspend Revissa upside down beneath a tree branch before she walks over to you, towering above your squirming body.

“Need some help?” she says mockingly.  

You have a witty reply prepared, but she glues your lips shut before you can speak it.]

A minute later, you find yourself just as bundled up as Revissa.  Clothing destroyed, weapons discarded, body slathered so tightly with silken fibers that movement is all but impossible.  The most you can do is squirm weakly, writhing on the ground like a worm, causing your exposed breasts to jostle invitingly.  The spider woman indulges you by giving them an affectionate squeeze.

“Now then,” she says, scooping you up in her arms and throwing you over a shoulder.  “You said something about another cutie you were concerned about?  What say we drop in and give her a visit?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="410" name="FE06AC" tags="" position="3800,2700" size="100,100">It’s a short trip back to the Knottie outpost, made all the more shorter since you don’t need to walk there.  The spider lady is strong enough to carry you both without breaking a sweat, and her silk remains firm, taut, and restrictive the entire time.  You’d hoped maybe you’d find some weakness or gap in your bindings on your way over, but try as you might, there’s nothing.  As much as you hate (but also are kind of happy) to admit, you’re completely and utterly helpless.  You and Revissa aren’t going anywhere under your own power; she’s got you, and unless someone rescues you soon, she’s going to keep having you for as long as she wants you.

When she arrives, the spider lady takes a look at the accommodations, quickly realizing that the area is abandoned.  

“Well, it’s no space yacht, but it’s better than living in a cave,” she says with a grin.

After a quick search she locates the storage room of one of the living quarters, and strings you up against a support beam, nodding approvingly at the way you add to the ambience.

“That’ll do.  We’ve got plenty of food and equipment, but our little operation here has been lacking in… entertainment.”

She strokes your tail lovingly, savoring the softness of your fur, before moving over to suspend Revissa upside down next to you.

“Two just isn’t enough.  We’re gonna need lots and lots of toys to keep morale up.  So let’s see if this friend of yours is down to pitch in.”

And then she leaves.  (if: $rosawake is true)[Once she’s gone, you hold on to a vain hope that Ros’eela might be able to escape her clutches.  After all, she’s an expert in bondage - both giving it and taking it.  Surely a single spider lady isn’t enough to stop her talents?  Unfortunately, you find your hopes dashed a few minutes later when your captor returns.

Sadly, when your captor returns, you find that none of those facts are true

“At first I was disappointed, because there wasn’t anyone moving - just some hunks of resin and some trophies on walls.  But then I realized that this one’s display frame wasn’t password-protected, so I thawed her out and bundled her up so that she could join the party!”]]

You spare a look for your pink-skinned friend.  Her body is completely slathered in webbing, hugging her frame with impossible tightness, save for her face, head tendrils, and breasts.  The spider woman wastes no time adhering her to the ceiling next to the two of you, increasing the size of her collection from two to three.  Noticing that her tendrils are not restrained, you think that, perhaps, they could be an avenue for her to unbind herself, but when you make eye contact with her Ros’eela seems to read your expression and shakes her head sadly to the negative.  As an expert in bondage, she has an intrinsic sense of when she’s totally beaten, and it seems like that is the case here.  She’s not getting free, and neither are you.

“Well, this is a good start,” the spider woman says, surveying her handiwork.  “But we’re going to need plenty more cuties as time goes by.  Oh, my name is Tula, by the way.  And I think we’re gonna be real good friends before long.”

She spends a bit more time appreciating her prisoners, before turning and leaving the room.  And so it seems that all hope is lost. (if: $petalfriend is true)[Or at least, it *seemed* that way… until you noticed the tell-tale scent of pollen in the air…

Directions become hazy in this part of the forest, with both your map and your senses becoming unreliable thanks to the unseen influence of a lurking threat.

But you’re already managed to overcome that challenge.  You know that you need to stand firm, to trust your mind and not what your eyes are telling you, to keep pushing forward, even if your surroundings stop making sense.  And so, as you draw closer to the ‘danger zone’, you take one last look at your holographic map, committing the route you want to take to memory, since soon that memory is all you’re going to be able to rely on.

Behind you, you still hear the spatter of webbing striking against trees, of silken lines propelling your pursuer towards you.  Revissa in her deer-taur form is faster than her, but speed isn’t always everything.  She can’t always take the most direct route between the trees, forcing her to occasionally veer off to the side, to stop and double back, to slow down to navigate a particularly clustered jumble of brush and thorns.  And the spider-lady capitalizes on that, never fully losing track of you.  But if you were to go just a little bit further…

You and your wife know what to expect.  This time, it’s not a mire of quicksand, but a sudden windstorm that tries to get in your way.  All your senses are telling you that a powerful hurricane has suddenly swelled up, causing branches to shake and leaves to fall in a whirlwind of colors around you.  Behind you, you hear the spider-lady curse, feel the thump as she loses her grip and falls to the ground.  She doesn’t know to expect this - but you do.  And so, as she struggles with the imaginary wind, you wrap your arms around Revissa’s waist and whisper reassuring words into her fuzzy ear, as her hooves slowly trot forwards, ignoring the intensity of the mentally conjured storm.

As before, your diligence pays off.  You push through the illusions, escape the gale-force winds that were never really there.  Before long the sound of it dies down to a gently swirling breeze, and then to nothing at all.  You don’t know what happened to the spider-lady, but the important thing is that she isn’t here.  At this point you finally venture a glance at your map, and find that you’re only a short walk away from the entrance.  You did it!

“That was some mighty fine galloping,” you say, sliding down off of Revissa’s back.  Once you’re off, she waves her staff around and dispels the transformation, returning to her normal, two-legged self.

“I’m just surprised you chose to run,” she says, doing some stretches to reacquaint herself with how bipedal bodies work.  “I half-expected you to surrender to that spider woman as soon as she appeared.”

“I mean, I was definitely considering it,” you say with a grin.  “Maybe the temptation wouldn’t be so high if you’d get around to learning how to shapeshift into a spider hybrid.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="412" name="FE06BB" tags="" position="3525,3075" size="100,100">According to your map, it’s a fairly straightforward path back to the forest’s entrance.  Sure, the trees are thickly clustered, but it’s mostly just a straight line without any topological abnormalities.  And so, what *should* happen as you and Revissa gallop along is that you make good progress, weaving through the trees more quickly than a spider lady can keep up.  But nothing is ever that easy, is it?

After ten minutes, you start to realize that the readout on your holo-map isn’t corresponding with the landscape in front of you.  No matter what directions you give to Revissa as she runs, it doesn’t seem to lead to you making any progress at escaping.  Is the map wrong somehow?  Are you reading it poorly?  Or is there something more nefarious at play?  You can’t be certain, but whatever the case, it’s clear that your efforts are being thwarted somehow. (if: $faewin is true)[It’s exactly like what happened with the quicksand pit earlier, though this time, there’s no gorgeous fae to bail you out of it.] Like it or not, you’re unable to escape using this route.

“We need to turn around,” you say grimly.  “This isn’t working.”

“Don’t you have a map?!” Revissa complains.

“I do but… I don’t know.  Something’s off here.”

“If I had time, I’d ask the forest for guidance,” Revissa says, “but I guess we don’t.”

And so she begins to turn around.  Maybe a different route will give better results.  However, no sooner does she swivel her cervine hips than another voice rings out from a tree branch above you.

“Oh, I don’t know… I think you’re both about to have all the time in the world!”

Before either of you have a chance to react, powerful lines of silk shoot out from the shadows, striking at Revissa’s legs with a sickening wet slap.  She grunts in surprise, and you feel her knees buckle as the silk forces her down into a kneeling position.

“Ack!” your wife screams, trying to pitch and buck her body to escape the powerful tethers.  Her movements nearly throw you off her back, causing you to grunt out as well.

The voice from above chuckles.  “Watch out, dearie.  You wouldn’t want to hurt your rider, would you?”

More silk flies outwards, catching your legs in such a way to glue your hips in place against Revissa’s back.  You reach for your weapon, but the spider-lady is faster, catching your sword from its holster and tossing it uselessly into the brush.  Only then does she drop down to show herself, admiring the way she’s immobilized both rider and mount.

“Now then… let’s get you two bundled up…”

It was all too easy for her to defeat you.  You may have been on deerback, but you’re no trained rider; mounted combat is not your forte.  So the spider was able to capitalize on your awkward position and render you helpless with her webbing.  Now you find yourself completely restrained, stripped of weapons and clothing and cocooned in place atop your wife’s back.  Revissa is equally defeated, unable to get up due to all the silk anchoring her to the forest floor.  The two of you grunt and squirm, writhe angrily and impotently as the spider woman watches with amusement, savoring the sight of your futile struggles.  Like it or not, she’s got you right where she wants you now, and you can’t imagine she’s going to be eager to let you go after the effort she made to catch you.

“As much fun as it is to watch this, I think it’s about time we brought you to your new home, don’t you think?”

You have no choice but to comply as she bustles about with the logistics of transporting you.

[[Get carried away-&gt;FE06BC]]
]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="413" name="FE06BC" tags="" position="3525,3200" size="100,100">Try as you might, neither you nor Revissa can move a muscle.  You’re both completely restrained and exposed, helpless as your captor inspects her catch from every angle.  

Interestingly, Revissa does not revert to her normal form, even after an extended period of motionlessness.  You know that normally, her transformation magic lasts for only a few hours at most.  Yet no matter how much time passes, she seems to retain her deer-taur shape.  Perhaps it’s some element of this strange planet?  You recall the discussion about Ghost Matter, how material made from it can keep restrained prisoners in stasis for an indefinite amount of time.  If the spider-woman’s webs have similar properties, then perhaps Revissa’s transformation can also last indefinitely, so long as she remains bound.  That’s the best idea you can come up with, because it certainly seems like Revissa is going to stay as she is for the foreseeable future.  

Though the lady is strong, you’re fairly certain she’s not strong enough to fully carry a deer-taur and its rider back to where she wants to go.  So for a while, you hold out hope that maybe she’ll need to leave you behind while she figures out a way to move you.  Sadly, that hope is quickly dashed.  She pulls out a communicator and makes a call, and within the hour several more women of the same species as her show up, ready to help with the task.  Many hands (or in this case, legs) make light work, as the saying goes, and soon enough you’re hoisted up and taken away.  You’re carried to the cliffs circling the west side of the forest, dragged into a hidden cavern entrance that leads to a network of natural tunnels.  This, apparently, is where the clan of spider-babes make their home.  Once they’ve gone far enough, you and Revissa are set down, and all of them slather you with more silk to glue you to the floor.  A few tentative struggles against the silk confirm the obvious - there is no way in hell you’re ever getting out of this on your own.

“Good work, girls!” says the red-skinned spider-babe who caught you.  Listening in on their conversations as they moved you confirms that her name is Tula, and that she seems to be the leader of this arachnid colony.  “You’ve all earned a break.”

She smiles as she looks towards your helplessly squirming bodies.

“These two will be the first public installations in the colony,” she explains to the group.  “That makes them *communal* property.  They’ll stay here out in the hallway, and are free to use for anyone who wants them.  No one is allowed to bring them back to their room, or to move them, without approval from the council.  Are we understood?”

There’s a murmur of agreement from the various spider-babes, but it’s clear from their faces some are considering spiriting you away in the night.

“I’m serious.  We’re a team, here, so we need to act like one.  Anyone found violating this rule becomes community property herself for a week.”

That leads to the ladies exchanging looks between themselves as if imagining what it would be like to have some of their co-workers at their mercy.

“Now then, we’ll draw straws for who gets to play with the new toys first.  Any questions?”

One spider raises her hand.  “Um… I found this on the floor,” she says, holding up a small electronic object.  Your eyes widen when you realize what it is - your communicator!”

Tula takes it with interest, slipping it over her wrist and quickly paging through the UI.  You mentally kick yourself for your laziness in not putting a password on it.

“Oh-ho… well, look what we have here.  It seems there’s four more morsels on the planet along with these two,” she says with a grin.  “Perhaps there won’t be as long a line as I thought for the community sex toys.”

You and Revissa can only exchange frightened glances.  Surely the rest of your crew will be able to avoid capture, right?  And come save you both in a flurry of heroics.

…right?

At this point, there’s nothing to do but pray, hope desperately that your friends can mount some kind of daring rescue.

But those hopes are dashed before long.  You hear several happily chattering voices coming from down the hallway, belonging to a bevy of the arachnid women who have just returned from the hunt.  A successful hunt, you’re sad to see.  

One of them hops ahead of the others, eager to add the prey she caught to the public repository of cocooned slaves.  She has two silken bundles draped over her arm, both of them squirming uselessly in her grasp.  One after the other, she lifts them up, spraying some tethers against the ceiling, then some anchors against the floor.  A few more are glued to nearby rocks to properly mount and display the pair of women she had claimed in her quest for slaves

Jyumon narrows her eyes in anger, grunting and groaning against the powerful bindings that have been slathered over nearly every inch of her fair and supple skin.  But no matter how much she squirms, she gets no leeway, finds no hope of salvation.  Vhaja fares no better, her long braids of hair swaying whenever she pitches and bucks her body to try and find some weakness in her bindings.  But these spider women are no novices, and she finds nothing but taut, firm restraints in every direction.  Eventually all they can do is flash each other helpless, defeated looks, knowing that this very well may be the end of their adventures together.]

The rest are brought in soon after, each of them just as helpless as the next.   Lumina is suspended from the ceiling, her wings folded behind her and completely mummified, to the point not even a single feather is visible from her cocoon.  But something else of hers is visible, which gives Krysta some solace as she is strung up alongside her.  At least she gets a silver lining now that she’s been lined in silvery strands, and her struggles are aimed not at freeing herself, but at swinging her face closer to the angel’s heavenly mounds.

But as everyone acclimates themselves to their new silken outfits, all you can think of is what comes next.  Your eyes dart towards the assembled arachnids, and you can see the eagerness in their expressions.  The prospect of a hunt delayed them from partaking of their spoils, but now that everyone is in their grasp, there’s nothing to stop them from finally indulging themselves.

And so, six cocooned captives can only brace themselves for what comes next, as a veritable swarm of horny spiders washes over them...

When flying solo she can stay in the air for hours, but it’s a struggle for her to do the same with a passenger, especially one as bulky as you are.  You figure it’s still a little bit further before you’re completely safe from the spider lady’s pursuit, but given what you know, it’s probably better not to risk flying through the cliffs region.  There could easily be more spider-babes lurking in wait, especially after you saw the red one making a call.

Instead, you give Revissa’s leg a tug to get her attention, then point downwards towards the forest floor.  She nods and descends, landing in a small clearing without any issue.  A twitch of a wing returns her to her normal humanoid form, though she takes a minute to do some stretches to reacquaint herself with having arms and feet.  

“Now what?” she asks.  “Where should we go next?”

Where next indeed.  If you’re ruling out the clifftop region, then you’ll need to pick an alternate route to escape.  Based on your previous reading of the map, that would mean you could either cut through the middle of the forest where the trees are thickest, or try to find the river and follow it back to the entrance.

A pair of gorgeous women stand below you.  For the most part, they have the appearance of elvaans.  Light purple skin and ivory-white hair, shapely bodies clad in form-fitting dresses that show off all of their wonderful curves.  But on their backs are a collection of spindly spider legs, twitching and writhing with powerful strength.  Limp lines of silk fall away from the tips of their back appendages, making clear they are the method by which they weave their stringy tethers.

“Look sister, I’ve spotted them!” says one.

“Right where Tula said they’d be!” says the other.

Well, crap.  It looks like your daring plan wasn’t quite so fool-proof after all.  And now you’re not just running from one spider, but *three*.  You tug on Revissa’s leg to get her attention, then point towards the trees.  She nods and begins to swoop downwards, to hopefully bring the two of you out of their line of sight.

“Oh, and they’re trying to escape,” says a spider girl.

“Exactly where Tula said they would,” the other agrees.

Surely they’re bluffing, right?  It’s not like they could have perfectly predicted the route you’d have taken.  Even so, as Revissa descends, you keep your eyes open for any kind of trap laid in the direction you flee.  But with the bright sun overhead, and the gossamer nature of the snare, you don’t notice it until it’s too late to avoid.

“Crap – there’s a net,” you yell, noticing the telltale spiral pattern of some woven webbing stretched between two of the trees.  “You need to–”

“No time!” Revissa yells, knowing more about her own aerodynamics than you do.  Realizing she’s bound for a collision, she instead releases her grip on your shoulders to ensure that you don’t slam into the web as well.

And then you start to fall, air whipping around you, the rush of wind in your ears, punctuated by a sticky *splat* as your wife collides with the expertly positioned trap.  It distracts your attention upwards towards her, making you forget about bracing for the fall until the impact with the ground knocks the wind from your lungs.

Your world spins, your head throbs, and your muscles ache.  For several precious seconds, you’re too disoriented from the pain to do much of anything except flail on the ground.  If only you were a few years younger, those seconds might have been spent springing into action, pushing your muscles to throw you to your feet so that you could execute a daring rescue.  Instead you simply groan and claw at a tree trunk to try and stand up, looking upwards just in time to see one of the two spider ladies snag her prey.]

Revissa squirms uselessly against the taut grip of the webbing, her wings and talons thoroughly tangled, her ‘modesty feathers’ shorn off to reveal her naked breasts to the open air.  A gag has already been spun over her lips to prevent her from crying for help, though you’re not sure what help you could provide, given how high up in the air she still is.

“I got mine!” says the spider lady standing beside her on a tree branch.

Even through your pain, you realize the inherent threat in that statement.  Because if one of them has already claimed Revissa, then–

*Splat*

The glob of webbing shoots out of nowhere, striking you in the chest and throwing you back down onto the forest floor.

“And I’ve got mine too!” says the second spider sister, her silhouette looming above you against the shadows of the branches overhead.]

Despite your best efforts, her statement proves to be true.  She moves so quickly, legs a blur as sharp points tear away your clothing, as soft hands press down against your flesh, as warm, wet silk glues itself over naked skin.  All you can do now that it’s finished is look up helplessly into the eyes of your captor as she appreciates her handiwork.  You’re completely cocooned, and totally at her mercy.  

[[Get carried away-&gt;FE06CC]]
]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="418" name="FE06CC" tags="" position="3925,3075" size="100,100">Try as you might, neither you nor Revissa can move a muscle.  You’re both completely restrained and exposed, helpless as your captors inspect their catches from every angle.  

Interestingly, Revissa does not revert to her normal form, even after an extended period of motionlessness.  You know that normally, her transformation magic lasts for only a few hours at most.  Yet no matter how much time passes, she seems to retain her avian shape.  Perhaps it’s some element of this strange planet?  You recall the discussion about Ghost Matter, how material made from it can keep restrained prisoners in stasis for an indefinite amount of time.  If the spider-woman’s webs have similar properties, then perhaps Revissa’s transformation can also last indefinitely, so long as she remains bound.  That’s the best idea you can come up with, because it certainly seems like Revissa is going to remain as she is for the foreseeable future.  

Despite their curvy frames, your captors prove to be quite strong.  Strong enough that each of them can scoop one of you up, sling you over her shoulder, and carry you away.  You’re taken back up to the cliffs then dragged into a hidden cavern entrance that leads to a network of natural tunnels.  This, apparently, is where the clan of spider-babes make their home.  Once they’ve gone far enough, you and Revissa are set down, and all of them slather you with more silk to glue you to the ceiling.  A few tentative struggles against the silk confirm the obvious - there is no way in hell you’re ever getting out of this on your own.

“Good work, girls!” comes a voice from the direction you were pulled in from.  You turn to see the red-skinned woman who first attacked you in the fruit orchard, along with a handful of other women with similar shapes as her.  “You’ve all earned a break.”

Based on the way she addresses the others, you get the sense that she is their leader.  They all spend some time chatting with each other, during which you learn that her name is Tula.  She smiles as she looks towards your helplessly squirming bodies.

“These two will be the first public installations in the colony,” she explains to the group.  “That makes them *communal* property.  They’ll stay here out in the hallway, and are free to use for anyone who wants them.  No one is allowed to bring them back to their room, or to move them, without approval from the council.  Are we understood?”

There’s a murmur of agreement from the various spider-babes, but it’s clear from their faces some are considering spiriting you away in the night.

“I’m serious.  We’re a team, here, so we need to act like one.  Anyone found violating this rule becomes community property herself for a week.”

That leads to the ladies exchanging looks between themselves as if imagining what it would be like to have some of their co-workers at their mercy.

“Now then, we’ll draw straws for who gets to play with the new toys first.  Any questions?”

One spider raises her hand.  “Um… I found this on the floor,” she says, holding up a small electronic object.  Your eyes widen when you realize what it is - your communicator!

Tula takes it with interest, slipping it over her wrist and quickly paging through the UI.  You mentally kick yourself for your laziness in not putting a password on it.

“Oh-ho… well, look what we have here.  It seems there’s four more morsels on the planet along with these two,” she says with a grin.  “Perhaps there won’t be as long a line as I thought for the community sex toys.”

You and Revissa can only exchange frightened glances.  Surely the rest of your crew will be able to avoid capture, right?  And come save you both in a flurry of heroics.

…right?

You decide it would be best to head through the middle of the forest, so you quickly move that way, keeping your eyes peeled for any signs of spider-babes web-slinging between the branches overhead.  

(if: $faewin is true)[However, only a short way in, you see signs of something else entirely.  There’s a swirl of leaves, a change in the texture of the air, the smell of ancient magic in your nostrils.  You turn to face her before she speaks, finding yourself looking into the beguiling eyes of a woman you had hoped you’d never have to see again.

[[Hello again, folks!  Did you miss me?-&gt;FE08D]]](else-if: $swampescape is true)[Luckily, you’ve been through this portion of the forest already, so you know the danger that you face.  Something here deep in the woods confounds your senses and disrupts your ability to navigate, but so long as you remain firm and confident in yourself, you’ll be able to get through.  And so you push forward together, ignoring your map and your senses and following your heart.

[[Make your escape-&gt;FE08C]]](else: )[Unfortunately, you’re not very familiar with this region of the forest.  And despite the fact that you have a topological map on your comm device, the further you go, the less the map seems to make sense.  Is it wrong somehow?  Or are you just bad at reading it?  Either way, you soon find yourself hopelessly lost, the entrance you came from seemingly infinitely far away from where you are now.

[[Admit you’re lost-&gt;FE08B]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="420" name="FE08A" tags="" position="4300,2825" size="100,100">After some thought, you point to the river displayed on your holo-map.  You know that the entrance to the forest is downstream from it, meaning if you needed to make a speedy getaway, the current would be working to your benefit.  Revissa nods in understanding, and agrees to follow you as you head in that direction.

Both of you feel a tension in the air as you creep towards your destination.  You know that you’re being followed, that at any moment a spider-lady could pop out and catch you in her expertly woven webs.  It’s nerve-wracking to be sure, but also just a *tiny* bit sexy.  At least to you.  To think, one wrong move and a gorgeous arachnid might have you at your mercy.  It’s like the plots in all those sexy holo-films you pretend not to own.  But you push down your arousal as you plot out a path, eventually leading you to the bubbling brook that flows through the eastern side of the forest.

You take a moment to watch the current, then take a deep breath and hold out your hand to your wife.

“On three?” you ask.  Revissa nods.  “One, two, three!”

And then you both leap, making a splash as you submerge yourselves in the water.  After all this running around, you’ve worked up quite the sweat, so the water feels cool and refreshing as it carries you away.  Still, though, you’re not fully relaxed.  You have no idea how good the spider ladies are at tracking people.  The forest is big, but it’s not like you took particular care at covering up your trail.  What if they manage to follow you to the river, realize what you’ve done, and set up a trap somewhere downstream?  What if they have a ship in orbit and try to catch you as you leave the planet?  And… what if they wrap you up so tight in their silk that you forget all about your worries and just learn to accept your fate as their plaything?

“Stop that,” Revissa says, bopping you on the head the next time you both pop up for air.

“Stop what?” you ask lamely.

“I’ve been married to you long enough to tell when you’re fantasizing about being kidnapped.  Now wipe that goofy smile off your face and get back to swimming.”

You cough awkwardly and turn your head away in embarrassment.  “Yes, ma’am,” you eventually say, before ducking back into the water once again.

Thankfully (or maybe, regrettably), you drift the rest of the way without incident.  Perhaps these spider ladies are not as good at tracking as you’d feared (or hoped).  And so, before long you’ve pulled yourself up on shore.  A glance at your comm device tells you it’s just a short walk back to the entrance of the forest.  

Revissa notices as you look forlornly behind you.  “Sorry, no silky kidnappings today,” she mutters, grabbing you by the tail and yanking you back towards your goal.

A line of web above, an anchor to the ground belong, and two more tethers to fasten her catch to some hanging rocks to the sides.

The rest are brought in soon after, each of them just as helpless as the next.   Lumina is set down on the floor, her knees buckled in a kneeling position, her wings folded behind her and fully covered with tight reams of webs.  Vhaja comes after, dropped to the ground behind the angel as if she were nothing more than a sack of potatoes.  With her lips sealed in a silken gag, she has no access to her magic, and thus no chance at enacting any sort of plan to help her escape.  And last comes Krysta, bent over at an odd angle due to the position she was caught in, glommed to the rocks above her to suspend her in the air.  Despite everything, she still finds a way to bend and twist to give herself a clear view of Lumina’s tantalizing bosom, causing the angel to look away in embarrassment. ]

She’s caught, you’re caught, your friends are caught, and the spiders are caught up in taking advantage of that, grinding themselves to completion just as often as they force you all into warm, wet, helpless throes of passion.

Though she’s not able to free you immediately, she does secure a deal with the spider-women that after a hundred years they’ll finally release you.

By the time you and your friends finally get to move again, the galaxy is much changed from how you remember it.

You faced it not that long ago, the cloying scent that drove you mad while you explored the outpost here.  And now, you smell it again.  Already, you can feel your pulse starting to rise, your libido kicking into overdrive, the sensations on your skin magnified as every nerve ending yearns for stimulation.  

Everything else fades away, and you begin to wriggle and writhe, to strain and struggle, to desperately try to find some way to bring yourself over the edge.  This webbing might be delightfully snug, but it’s clear it was woven with the intent for someone else to play with you - not for you to play with yourself.  And so you find yourself overwhelmed with desire, frustrated with helplessness, unable to provide that last bit of pressure needed to send you over the edge.

“Mmmphh… mmmph!” you yell, locking eyes with Ros’eela, who appears to be in a similar state.  Her head tendrils aren’t long enough to reach her crotch, and her suspended position means she has no way to maneuver herself that will allow her to grind against anything.  Being captured was bad enough, but this is just plain torture!

At least, it is until some helpful vine tendrils creep in through the door and wrap themselves around your bodies.  They press themselves between your legs, insert themselves right where they are needed to bring you the release you so desire.  What follows is the most overwhelming orgasm of your life, so mind-numbing you lose all sense of awareness for several long minutes, completely subsumed by the pleasure you’ve finally been granted.  Which is why you don’t notice that Revissa is cut down long before either of you are.

When you finally come to your senses, you find her standing over you in her normal human form, holding the rune-imbued knife Vhaja entrusted to you in her hand.

“What… what happened?” you murmur in your post-coital haze.

“I was able to grab hold of a little bit of ivy on my tail when she was dragging us here,” Revissa explains, “and through it, was able to commune with the trees to find Petal.”

Petal!  Of course!  If you smelled the pollen, she shouldn’t be far behind.  But wait… if Petal showed up… then does that mean…

“See for yourself,” Revissa says, reading the expression on your face.  You follow her outside, and are stunned to find that your spider problem has been taken care of.

Tula looks like she was about to put up a fight, her legs all spread out around her, the expression on her face combative and defiant.  But that didn’t do her much good.  Petal caught her all the same, perhaps capitalizing on how disoriented she must have been from the pollen.  Her naked body glistens beneath the honey-colored amber, Tula’s naked figure openly exposed yet hopelessly cut off from any external contact.

“Well, did I do good?” comes a sugar-sweet voice from behind her.

Leaves unfurl and Petal appears within her flower, looking every bit as chipper as she did when last you met.  It seems that making friends with her really paid off!  

“Yeah… more than good.  I’m sure this lady was going to cause more problems for the forest,” you say.  “But now she’s just a lovely paperweight.”  You meet eyes with the bewitching flower woman and smile.  “How can we ever repay you for saving us?”

She chuckles.  “Well… I can think of one way.  You all got to have some fun with my vines before… but I couldn’t exactly go into the building to join you.”

Those very same vines curl around you now, already in the process of lifting you, Revissa, and Ros’eela up into the air.  All of you exchange glances, then nod in agreement.  There’s no reason in the world not to go for a second round of stimulation.  It’s only fair, after all.

There’s nothing any of you can do.  Even Ros’eela is helpless, despite her talent at escaping.  You’re left alone together for many hours, perhaps even days, but the entire time none of you ever feel tired, hungry, or sore.  Furthermore, Revissa remains in her mermaid shape, even though normally she can only maintain a transformation for a few hours at most.  Both must be the result of Ghost Matter - perhaps Tula’s silk is imbued with its properties somehow.  Whatever the case, it’s clear that the only way you’re leaving this place is if someone comes along to rescue you.

But that rescue never comes.  You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew.  Maybe they got captured somewhere else on the planet, or maybe they tried to find you but were eventually forced to give up.  Either way, you remain the prisoner of spider women for the rest of your lives.  When Tula does eventually return, she has many more of her kind with her, and together they settle into the outpost and make it their own.  The three of you are integral in keeping up morale, acting as sex toys for the lusty arachnids that they use whenever the desire takes them - which is very often.  In those early days, there’s basically never a moment when you’re not in use, handed off from one spider to another to cuddle, fondle, and grope.

Over the years, however, they eventually build up a larger stock of slaves, to the point that your storage room becomes filled to the brim with squirming, writhing bundles of silk, women who were caught and cocooned just like you.  No one ever saves you.  You’re not even people any more, just objects – tools, a service provided by the growing spider-girl settlement to keep up morale.   And though that may be all that you’ll ever be from now on, at least your service will always get good reviews!

Well, lucky for you that you swallowed that Star Scout homing candy at the start of your mission.  Thanks to that, Krysta and the rest of your crew are able to track you down, and enact a daring rescue while the spider lady is away on other business.  They quickly take you to your ship and leave the planet, heading off into space.  Unfortunately, it looks like getting captured tipped the spiders off about the data collection device you planted at the orchard, so by the time you’re in orbit you find that the device has been disabled.  Sadly, that means your mission is a failure, though at least you managed to escape with your freedom.

It seems that they moved more quickly than you had anticipated, and are eager to join the pursuit.

“Look sister, I’ve spotted them!” says one.

“Right where Tula said they’d be!” says the other.

Well, crap.  It looks like your daring plan wasn’t quite so fool-proof after all.  And now you’re not just running from one spider, but *three*.  You tug on Revissa’s leg to get her attention, then point beneath you towards the trees.  She nods and begins to swoop downwards, to hopefully bring the two of you out of their line of sight.

“Oh, and they’re trying to escape,” says a spider girl.

“Exactly where Tula said they would,” the other agrees.

Surely they’re bluffing, right?  It’s not like they could have perfectly predicted the route you’d have taken.  Even so, as Revissa descends, you keep your eyes open for any kind of trap laid in the direction you flee.  But with the bright sun overhead, and the gossamer nature of the snare, you don’t notice it until it’s too late to avoid.

“Crap – there’s a net,” you yell, finally spotting the telltale spiral pattern of some woven webbing stretched between two of the trees.  “You need to–”

“No time!” Revissa yells, knowing more about her own aerodynamics than you do.  Realizing she’s bound for a collision, she instead releases her grip on your shoulders to ensure that you don’t slam into the web as well.

And then you start to fall, air whipping around you, the rush of wind in your ears, punctuated by a sticky *splat* as your wife collides with the expertly positioned trap.  It distracts your attention upwards towards her, making you forget about bracing for the fall until the impact with the ground knocks the wind from your lungs.

Your world spins, your head throbs, and your muscles ache.  For several precious seconds, you’re too disoriented from the pain to do much of anything except flail on the ground.  If only you were a few years younger, those seconds might have been spent springing into action, pushing your muscles to throw you to your feet so that you could execute a daring rescue.  Instead you just groan and claw at a tree trunk to try and stand up, looking upwards just in time to see one of the two spider ladies snag her prey.]

“I got mine!” says the spider lady standing beside her on a tree branch.

Despite your best efforts, her statement proves to be true.  She moved so quickly, legs a blur as sharp points tore away your clothing, as soft hands pressed down against your flesh, as warm, wet silk glued itself over naked skin.

She and her sister had pursued you through these very cliffs not too long ago.  But while this one stayed back after snaring Revissa, you had led the other one deep into the forest… where she’d gotten caught in the thrall of the psychic forest predator.  Last you’d seen of her, she was curled up and asleep, trapped in a mental prison.

But since that sister is missing, another lovely spider-cutie has taken her place.   This one has bright pink skin and big, beady green eyes, wearing a pretty silken dress and with fuzzy fur covering her back legs.  She immediately squees in delight when she sees the targets she’s been recruited to capture.

Okay… well, at least she seems friendly.  Even if she still plans on keeping you forever.  But she also seems somewhat more reasonable than the other spider-ladies you’ve met so far.  Maybe there’s something you can still do to try and escape?

She lets out another delighted squeal as she watches you struggle.  “Aww, you make just the cutest sounds!  And I’ll bet you’ll make even cuter sounds when we’re playing!”

Despite her appearance she is still quite strong.  She easily scoops you up into her arms, cradling you lovingly.

“Mmphhh!” you yell, in an attempt to let her know that you’d much rather have fun with her while not slathered in silk.  But nothing you say is intelligible.

“There, there, it’s okay.  We’re going to have some much fun soon.  Happy together, for ever and ever… and ever!”

One of her back legs bends towards your neck, and you feel the tiniest pinprick against your skin as she injects you with some kind of toxin.

“Now rest up, cutie… soon you’ll be at your new home.”

No, wait, this isn’t what you want.  Dammit… this is bad.  Really bad.  You feel dizzy and your vision starts to go blurry, but you manage to look up towards Revissa one last time.  Sadly, she’s just as helpless as you are, so you both can only lock eyes desperately before you fully black out.

But Merry doesn’t seem as ruthless as the other spider women you’ve met.  Perhaps… even a bit naive.  Is there maybe some way you can use this against her?

“I can already think of all the fun things we’re going to do together!” she says, completely oblivious to the fact that you’re plotting against her.  “I just hope they let me keep you.”

Her hand strokes your tail lovingly, her face nuzzles against your cheek.  It’s altogether not the… *worst* feeling in the world, being coddled and cuddled like a beloved pet.  But no!  You’re not a domesticated dog, you’re a proud and cunning wolf!  Which is why… maybe it’s time to try a bit of deception.

“Mmmph!” you grunt, the pressure of the silk against your lips preventing words from forming.  “Grrmmphh!”

Your words are not intelligible… but that’s partially because you’re not even trying to make words at all.  All you’re doing is grunting, trying to get her attention.

“What’s the matter girl?  Has Tula fallen down a well?”

You shake your head no.  And then you grunt again, and tilt your neck towards some nearby bushes.

“Oh?  Is… is something over there?”

You nod.  Not that there actually *is* anything over there, but if you could just get her away from you for a few minutes, maybe you can wriggle your way over to your pack and pull out your knife.

“Okay… don’t worry.  I’ll handle it!” Tula says, before stepping in front of you protectively.  “Whatever you are, you’re not going to hurt my new friend!”

It would almost be dashing of her, if she were not also in the process of kidnapping you.  Though she of course does not get any response from the non-existent threat.

“Stay away!  Or I’ll wrap you up good and tight!” Merry yells, before she thwips a few shots of webbing into the foliage.

But then, to everyone’s surprise (yours most of all) something rustles in the spot where she shot.  Wait… was there *actually* something over there?

“That’s right!  Go on, git!” Merry says, taking a few steps forward.

As she does, the figure emerges from the brush.  Merry looks down at it and squees.

“Aww… what a cutie!  You’re not a scary monster at all.  You’re just a cute little lizard, aren’t yo—-”

Unfortunately, you didn’t, which means now you’ve met the gaze of a basilisk that was prowling for food in the bushes.  A moment later, and you’re a statue too, as frozen and immobile as poor Merry.  The sound of your petrification echoes through the forest, attracting the attention of the remaining spider-girl who was busy playing with Revissa up in the branches.

She hops down to investigate, but by the time she gets to where you are, the basilisk has fled, and two inert stone figures are left behind in its wake.  To her credit, she seems upset at your fate, though that may just be because now she no longer has a warm and squishy sex toy to occupy her with.

Not that it really concerns you anymore.  You’re unable to move, to speak, or even to think.  You see nothing, hear nothing, and know nothing, unable to do anything but stay in the place where you were transformed, as powerless as any other hunk of rock left in the forest.

“Ugh… I guess now I need to drag this all the way back…” she groans, tapping your granite face in annoyance.  You, of course, do not react at all.

You’re not sure which is worse.  The fact that she completely no-sold your struggles, or the fact that she didn’t even *realize* you were trying to resist her.  

“Grrrmmphh!” you yell.  With all the strength you can muster, you reel back, then headbutt her right in the face!

“Ow!” she yells sharply.  Well, it didn’t accomplish much, but at least you feel a bit better that you were able to hurt. 

 “That… looks like it hurt!” she continues.  And then she starts to gingerly rub your forehead.  “You need to be more careful, cutie.  Wriggling around like and you might get a bruise on that adorable face of yours.”

Ouch.  Your head will recover from that, but your pride never will. 

“Anyway… I guess we’ll have to make sure you don’t hurt yourself anymore for now…”

To the surprise of both of you, a small voice suddenly emanates from somewhere nearby.  

“Damn, this is tight,” it says.

Wait a second… that’s what you were just trying to say!  How did it– of course!  The sound must be coming from the gag-talk translator you have in your bag.  It had been useful when communicating with Ros’eela before.  Maybe it can also be helpful when *you’re* the one all bundled up.

“Grrmppgghh… mmmphh!” you say.  

The translator hums to life.  “Hey there, spider cutie.  Before you finish dragging me away to your sex dungeon, do you mind if we have a little chat first?”

Yes, you said all that with a few grunts and groans.  It’s more about the intent than actual words, anyway.

Merry has a look of confusion as she walks over to your bag, pulling out the device.  She stares at it, then turns and stares at you, and then back to the device.

“That thing is translating my words,” you explain.  “I know I’m just a cute cuddle-toy to you, but believe it or not, I’m a fully sapient being with my own thoughts, hopes, and dreams.  I’m like, a full person, dude.”

“Well, of *course* you’re a person, silly!  That’s why I’m going to treat you with all the love and care and attention you deserve!  Don’t worry, I promise you’ll be super happy once we get you home.”

Okay… so she’s still got her heart set on kidnapping you.  But this is a good start.  If you play your cards right, you may be able to get out of here.

Though sadly, they don’t have access to any magic or technology that is capable of changing you back.  If only they would have thought to look in your bag, they’d have found the restoration crystals Lumina entrusted you with that could have done the trick.  But they don’t think to do that, nor do they ever ungag Revissa to give her the chance to explain.  Merry gets shipped off-world for treatment, but no one bothers to do the same for you.

And so, you end up as little more than a paperweight left laying around the caverns the spiders call home.  They never even get around to peeling off the silk that had been wound around you.  Revissa ends up getting glued to the wall with webbing right across from you, trapped in place and used as a communal sex toy for the colony of arachnids to pleasure themselves with at their leisure.  Whenever they finish with her, she looks across the way at your petrified form, and wonders which of the two of you has it better.  Sometimes she’ll wish for the slumber of stone over the indignity of being a spider slave.

No help ever comes for either of you, and neither of you ever see the rest of your crew again.  Whether that’s because they weren’t able to locate you at all, or if they tried to but ended up captured by some different peril on the planet is anybody’s guess.  You’ll never know for certain, not the least of which is because you’re incapable of knowing anything at all.   

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="434" name="FE09DY" tags="" position="5350,3200" size="100,100">You do eventually make it back to the spider-girls’ lair.  Though sadly, they don’t have access to any magic or technology that is capable of changing you back.  If only they would have thought to look in your bag, they’d have found the restoration crystals Lumina entrusted you with that could have done the trick.  But they don’t think to do that, nor do they ever ungag Revissa to give her the chance to explain.  

And so, you end up as little more than a paperweight left laying around the caverns the spiders call home.  They never even get around to peeling off the silk that had been wound around you.  Revissa ends up getting glued to the wall with webbing right across from you, trapped in place and used as a communal sex toy for the colony of arachnids to pleasure themselves with at their leisure.  When they finish with her, she looks across the way at your petrified form, and wonders which of the two of you has it better.  Sometimes she’ll wish for the slumber of stone over the indignity of being a spider slave.

It’s two weeks before anything changes in your situation.  Thanks to the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed, your crew eventually manages to track you down.  Though with so many spiders lurking about, a direct rescue mission is out of the question.  Instead, they exchange all the data they’d gathered on the planet - as well as Lumina’s healing techniques to cure Merry’s plight - for you and Revissa’s safety.  

Though you don’t find out about that until later, when your ship is already light-years away from the planet and they finally have the time to cure your petrification.  At least you won’t be a rock for the rest of your life, but sadly, your slip-up has caused your mission to end in failure.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="435" name="FE09E" tags="" position="5225,2825" size="100,100">As you sleep, you’re overwhelmed by dreams.  Warm dreams, happy dreams, erotic dreams; dreams where you’re safe and secure, happy, though helpless.  

When you finally open your eyes, you find there was some truth to the visions you saw while unconscious.  Because your body is tightly encased in silk, wrapped around your legs, encasing your arms, slathered over your lips.  And that’s when you remember what happened.  You were captured by a pretty spider girl, wrapped up tight then drugged with venom.  And now you’re here.

You’re laying on a bed, and you feel like you’re in a bedroom, but the air is wrong, all dank and moldy and stale.  Plus it’s dark.  The only light source is from a small jar on a nightstand beside the bed, where some bioluminescent mushrooms cast an eerie, greenish glow over the room.  So you must be in a cave - probably a passage dug into the cliffs overlooking the forest.  And you’re wrapped up, helpless, and alone.

Though not for long.

“Ooh, hi cutie!  Are you awake now?”

Merry comes in from an opening concealed behind a curtain at the edge of the room, grinning wildly as she sees her new toy is ready to be played with.  She immediately flops down onto the bed and pulls you into her arms, resting your head on her lap as she idly strokes your ears and tail.

“Mmmmph!” you grunt, unable to vocalize anything through your gag.

“Awwww… what cute sounds you make!” she says, gently squeezing one of your exposed breasts as a reward for entertaining her.  That just elicits more grunts… or would it be more accurate to call it a moan?

“I’m so happy that Tula let me keep you!  She said anyone we catch is supposed to be ‘communal property’, but she was nice enough to make an exception for me.  Which means that we’ll get to be best friends!  Forever!”

Your eyes widen… but it’s hard to tell if it’s out of fear or… excitement.  Because being owned by such a cuddly and nurturing spider-gal isn’t the *worst* fate in the world.  Though, as you squirm and struggle, and as she strokes and pats, you realize that this *is* your fate… and that you don’t seem to have any way to get out of it…

She plays with you, she talks with you, she cuddles you, and she even takes you out on walks.  The walks you tend to enjoy the most, since you get carried out into the hallways beyond her bedroom, where you get to see Revissa.  Unlike you, your wife has become communal property, a toy for the spider-babes who live here to be groped and molested to their heart’s desire.  Sometimes, Merry lets the two of you go on ‘play-dates’, which basically just means you’re glued to the wall beside her for a few hours and ‘borrowed’ by the other residents of the cavern.

Not once does she ever unravel the silk spun around your body.  Not once is the idea of you getting to go free even considered.  You’re a toy now, a pet, and that’s all you’ll ever be.  A pet who is loved and cherished, to be fair, but a pet all the same.  Thankfully, her silken webbing is imbued with the planet’s Ghost Matter, meaning you’ll never need to eat again, never need to heed the call of nature, will never grow old or feel pain, so long as the material encases your skin.  Though it also means there will never be an end to your imprisonment.

You never find out what happened to the rest of your crew.  Perhaps they fell prey to some other peril in this world.  Or maybe they tried to find you but gave up, forced to abandon the planet and the mission.  All you know is that you’ll never see them again.

From now until the end of your days, this is your new reality - a spider’s toy, a helpless pet.  There might be worse ways to end your career, but there might also have been better ones.  You’ll never find out, because you’ll never know anything other than this.

And that might have been the end of the road for both of you, if not for the Star Scout candy you swallowed at the start of your adventure.  Through it, your friends manage to track down your location.  Of course, with so many spiders around, they can’t just run in guns blazing and save you.  But they do manage to open up a line of communication, and negotiate for your and Revissa’s release – in exchange for all the data they’ve gathered on the planet up until now.

Thanks to that, you both get to return to your ship, after only a few months as helpless slaves.  But sadly, it also means that your mission was a failure.  Maybe next time, you’ll be more careful around spiders - even cute ones.

“Well, going home with you does sound fun… but maybe we could get to know each other first?”

That seems to confuse her.  “But… we can learn all about each other once you’re nice and safe and secure in my room, right?  We can do lots and lots of cuddling and… other things.  Hrmm… assuming Tula lets me keep you though…”

Okay, that sounds like a thread you can tug.  “Why wouldn’t Tula let you keep me?” you ask through the translator.

“Well… we’re *supposed* to be sharing the cuties we catch… something about ‘community property to boost morale’.  But… I kinda want you all to myself…”

This might be your chance.  What can you say to turn this situation around?

But maybe you can find some common ground that will convince her to treat you like a person and not a pet.  The gag translator hums as it converts your grunts into speech.

First off, start with some flattery.  “I gotta tell you… if I had to be caught by anyone, I’m glad it was you,,” you say.  “You seem way nicer than those other spiders.  I’m sure that we would have a lot of fun back in your lair, but–”

The flattery makes her face erupt into a brilliant smile, making her excited enough to not listen to the rest of your sentence.  “Aww… thank you so much, cutie!  I can’t wait to get you home.  We’re going to be the bestest of friends!  In fact… there’s no point in waiting, let’s head there now!”

“Wait–” you begin to say, but then she switches off the translator.  “Hrrmmhhggh?  Mmmrrrpgghh!”

“It’s okay, cutie.  Best friends don’t need words to communicate!”

She skitters over and pulls you into her arms, cradling you lovingly.   And then she suddenly jabs you with the tip of one of her legs, injecting some kind of toxin into your body.  “Now go on and take a nap, and I’ll handle the rest, okay?”

No, wait, this isn’t what you want.  You were supposed to open up a dialogue, not end it! Dammit… this is bad.  Really bad.  You feel dizzy and your vision starts to go blurry, but you manage to look up towards Revissa one last time.  Sadly, she’s just as helpless as you are, so you both can only lock eyes desperately before you fully black out.

[[Wake up at home-&gt;FE09E]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="440" name="FE09CC" tags="" position="5475,2700" size="100,100">You’ve got some good info to go on, but you feel like there’s more to learn about this spider cutie.  So you try to keep her talking.

“That’s really unfair, making everyone share,” you say through the translator.  “Instead everyone should just get to keep any girls they catch, don’t you think?”

Merry nods.  “Exactly.  Though I guess not everyone in the colony is from good hunting families like me, Tula, and the sisters,” she says to herself.

“Oh?  Are you, uh… spider royalty or something?” you venture.

Your captor chuckles.  “Well, we’re all princesses, silly!  Because Spider Princesses are the daughters of Spider Queens, after all.”

She goes on to explain her heritage.  As you well know, Spider Queens are an entire race of galactic warlords, more monstrous in appearance than Merry and her kin because from the waist down they have the bodies of massive arachnids.  But as it turns out, any half-breed daughters they sire are called Spider Princesses, and look mostly humanoid, save for the spindly legs coming from their backs.

“Of course… I guess I *am* a bit more special, since *both* my moms are queens!  Uh… or were queens?  My Elvaan mom was dethroned a couple centuries ago I think…”

Sometimes you forget just how insane it is that some races measure their age in centuries, whereas kemomi like you are lucky if they even make it to seventy.  

“Wow, you do sound really special,” you say.  “Special enough that you deserve your own personal playthings, right?  Let me guess… is your spider mom kind of a big deal too?”

Merry nods vigorously.  “Yup!  She’s really good at business and something called… in-vest-ing?  Because I asked her really nicely she gave us all the money to set up our base here for Tula’s fruit-selling plan.”

She goes on to explain that the fruits from the orchard where you first encountered Tula, the red-skinned spider, are part of an enterprise she is planning.  Because when spider-folk consume the fruits (which are made from Ghost Matter), they confer the properties of those fruits into their silk, ensuring the webbed up captives stay healthy and satiated no matter how long they’re cocooned for.  All of that is good to know… but more relevant to your current situation is that Merry seems to be ‘the boss’s daughter’... and that probably means she gets special treatment.

“So… I don’t know, it seems unfair that I don’t get to keep who I catch, especially after all my mom does for them!” she concludes after several more minutes of chattering

From up above, you hear the spider-girl who captured Revissa start to skitter downwards, probably picking up on the conversation the two of you are having.  If you’re going to say something to get out of this, now is going to have to be the time!

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="441" name="FE09CD" tags="" position="5350,3075" size="100,100">Alright, there’s some tension between her and her fellow spiders.  Maybe you can use that against her.

“That does sound like a problem,” you say through the translator.  “They might not let you keep me… and then we wouldn’t get to have fun together.  And I really, really wanna be your pet, not anyone else’s!”

You flash her your most innocent, puppy-dog eyes.  Merry swoons from the cuteness, rubbing your ears affectionately, and then seems to make her choice.

“That makes me so happy to hear!”  She looks around furtively.  “Okay… in that case… we’ll just have to hide you away somewhere.  You’ll be nice and safe and secure, and I’ll make sure to visit you every day.  How does that sound?”

Before you get a chance to reply, she switches off the translator, so all you do is make some muffled grunts.

“Sorry, but we need you to be quiet, or the plan won’t work,” she says, as she scoops you up into her arms.  Despite her cuteness, she’s still stupidly strong, and doesn’t seem burdened at all by your weight.  “Okay… let’s head out into the forest…”

And so, you and she go off into the woods, leaving Revissa and the other spider lady behind.

[[Find the perfect spot-&gt;FE09F]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="442" name="FE09F" tags="" position="5600,2700" size="100,100">Wrapped up tight like you are, there’s not much you can do as Merry carries you away.  The silk is taut and firm, not giving you even an inch of leeway, and it’s too sturdy to tear without the use of a weapon - meaning escape doesn’t seem like a viable option.  But at least she’s carrying you away from the other, more aggressive spider lady, which means there’s still some kind of chance for you out here.

“Hmm… this looks like a nice and cozy spot, don’t you think?”

You look around as she comes to a halt, and realize that a spider-girl probably has a very different definition of cozy than you do.  You’re deep in the forest, in a shadowy part of the woods which smells strongly of rot and decay.  There’s not much sunlight here, with dead, scraggly branches forming a spooky canopy over the ground.

“Mmmphh…” you say nervously.

“Oh, hold on!” Merry replies, and switches the translator back on.  You’re surprised that she’s nice enough to do that for you.

“Mmmphh,” you say again, but this time the device hums as it converts your sounds into audible speech.  “Yeah… this is uh… really scenic.”

“Right?!  It’s a really cute spot,” Merry says, as she starts weaving a spiral net suspended between two trees with her silk. “I’m really looking forward to spending time with you here.  It’ll be our little secret!” 

When she’s done with the net, she picks you up and adheres you in place with a few more tethers, pressing down on your shoulder to make sure it can support your weight.  The silk is springy and soft, and seems like it will hold firm.

“There, how’s that?”

“Super comfy…” you say through the device.  And then an idea starts to form in your head  “But, well…”

Merry tilts her head to the side nervously.  “Oh no, is something wrong?  Is the silk not tight enough?  I can wrap you up even more if you want!”

“No!  No, uh… no, it’s not that.  It’s just, well… forests can be a dangerous place.  And even if I’m hidden away from your friends, you’re not going to be able to be by my side all the time.  What if some forest monster comes along and sees me here, and decides to drag me away somewhere else?  Or even worse, what if it tries to hurt me?  I’ll be helpless to defend myself.”

“Oh… oh no!” Merry says, legitimately upset at the thought of harm befalling her new pet.  “That’s true… I guess we’ll have to take you back to the colony after all…”

You shake your head quickly.  “No… we don’t need to do that.  You just… well, you just need to leave me something to defend myself with, right?  That way, if a monster comes along, I can scare it away.”

Merry nods along in understanding.  “Hmm… that does make sense.  But what can I leave you with?”

“Well… how about my sword?  You can just strap it up right there next to me in the silk.  That way, if I get attacked, I can cut myself free and escape from the monster.  And then once it’s gone, I will of course come back here and wiggle myself into your web again, nice and snug, so I’ll be all bundled up for you when you return.”

There’s a long pause as Merry studies your face closely.  Have you misjudged her?  Is she more savvy, less trusting than you’d initially thought?  But then she claps her hand and smiles.

“That’s a great idea!  I’m really impressed with you.  All my friends are going to be so jealous that I have such a cute and smart little wolfie!”

You breathe out in relief as Merry gets to work gluing your sword next to you on the net.  Luckily she brought all your gear along with you together with the translator.

“How’s that?”

You glance towards the sword, then back towards Merry.

“Perfect.  It’s… just barely in reach, I think, if I stretch as far as I can.  So I won’t be accidentally bumping into it unless I really need to.”

“Yay!” Merry says warmly, skittering over to give you a big, spidery hug with her arms *and* all of her legs.  “Now, you stay right here, all snug and wrapped up, and I’ll go make sure no one followed us.  But then, I promise to visit you each and every day, okay?”

You nod yes, and get a kiss on the forehead for your trouble.  It almost feels bad tricking her like this.  And… you almost wonder what it would be like to actually just be her cute and cuddly little pet.  Surely there are *worse* fates in the world than that, right?

“Okay, see you later!” she says, and then vanishes into the forest.

Honestly, you’re surprised that worked.  But now you’re alone, and you have a weapon to get you out of this mess.  At this point, what could possibly go wrong?

Like you told her, the sword is just barely within your reach.  But you’ve got to stretch as far as you can go, really squirm and strain to cover those scant few inches.  A little more… just a bit further, and —

*Snap*

Suddenly you hear the sound of a foot crunching down on a dead twig nearby.  Crap, did Merry come back already?  Did she forget something?  Is she going to realize you were lying?  You take a deep, anxious breath, then turn towards the sound.

That was a big mistake.

You only get a glimpse of it before you realize your folly.  It’s a squat lizard with a bulky frame, a barbed prong at the end of its tail, and two bright, beady eyes that seem to draw you into them as you meet its gaze.  You’ve met creatures like this before, and you know they’re called.

Basilisks.

That’s the last thing that crosses your mind before you’re swiftly converted into a statue of stone, naked and strung up in silk.  The lizard looks up at you in confusion, wondering how this big creature found its way into its lair, but then turns away with disinterest once it realizes the intruder is no longer a threat.  Sadly, all you can do is stare forward with sightless eyes, unthinking, unmoving.

Well, not *entirely* unmoving.  Since after a few minutes, your greatly increased body weight causes the webbing holding you aloft to buckle and tear, dropping you down to the ground with a hard, stony *thunk*.  Luckily your petrified form is quite sturdy, so not even a hair on your head is damaged by the impact.  But it doesn’t change the fact that you’re hard as a rock, with no immediate prospects of being restored.

And be it out of guilt or compassion, she still honors her word and comes by every day to play with her petrified bestie.

You, of course, are never aware of this, because you’re just a hunk of stone.  And though it wouldn’t be particularly difficult to turn you back into flesh with the right magic or technology, Merry never thinks to do this.  Instead she just skitters over once a day and has one-sided conversations with her stony friend, holding tea parties, dressing you up in silk, confiding in you all her hopes and fears.  If you were able to hear her, you’d probably really appreciate the company.  

But you can’t.  You’re just a frozen hunk of granite now, and that’s all you’ll ever be, for the rest of your days.  Sadly, Merry never did get her pet wolfie.  But she still has a pet rock.

You’re restored to flesh back on your ship, after which point you tell your friends where they can find Revissa.  Unfortunately, the only way they can negotiate for her release is surrendering all the research data on the planet, so while you do get her back, your mission proves to be a bust.

But at least you didn’t spend the rest of your life as Merry’s prisoner.  Though she’ll always be sad that she lost her pet rock.

Merry nods her head in determination.  “Yeah!  I’m gonna go right up to Zauzyne and give her a piece of my mind!”

Yes, this is exactly what you wanted.  Once they start fighting, maybe you’ll be able to wiggle away in the confusion.  There’s a knife in your pack, so if you could just get over to it, you could cut yourself free!

A soft skittering of chitinous legs announces Zauzyne’s arrival as she arrives on the forest floor with you.

“Merry!”  she says sharply.  “You shouldn’t be letting your slaves talk so much.”

Merry shakes her head.  “Oh, I know.  Once we’re back home I’ll make sure she never makes any sound other than happy grunts and moans.  But… that’s not what I wanted to tell you.”  She takes a deep breath and narrows her eyes.  “I… have decided I’m keeping this one for myself!  I don’t want to share her with anybody!”

There is a long pause, before Zauzyne smiles warmly.  “Huh?  Of course.  Go right ahead,” she says.  “After all you’ve done for us, it’s only fair.  I’m sure Tula feels the same way.”

“...really?” Merry murmurs, tears of happiness forming in her eyes.  Your eyes are starting to tear up as well, but out of fear.

“Of course!  Go on and keep her.”

“Forever?” Merry asks.

“Sure.”

“And ever and ever?”

“Absolutely.  You deserve it.  I mean, who could say no to that cute face of yours?”

Merry erupts with happiness.  “Yaaaay!”  She thwips you with a shot of webbing and reels you in for a big hug.  “Did you hear that?!  We get to be together forever!”

“I kind of thought that would go differently…” you say, your words echoing from the device in Merry’s hand.

Zauzyne notices the translator and gently takes it.  “Hrmm…” she mutters, before she crushes it in her palm.  Then she turns and looks you right in the eye.  “No more trying to corrupt our innocent little Merry.”

“Mmmphh…!” you say helplessly.  Your body quivers with fear as you realize just how screwed you are now.  And that’s when you feel a pinprick of pain on your neck, as Merry uses one of her back legs to inject you with some kind of toxin.

“Now rest up, cutie… soon you’ll be at your new home.”

No, wait, this isn’t what you want.  Dammit… this is bad.  Really bad.  You feel dizzy and your vision starts to go blurry, but you manage to look up towards Revissa one last time.  Sadly, she’s just as helpless as you are, so you both can only lock eyes desperately before you fully black out.

And now, there’s another spider lady about to drop down and join you.  Merry might be naive and easily manipulated, but the other one will surely not be so simple to decieve.  But… if Merry is the boss’s daughter, then perhaps looking after her is more important to these ladies than making sure their slaves don’t escape.  So what if you spooked Merry and got her to run away – would the other woman chase after her?  It’s worth a shot!

“Mmmph!” you grunt, the pressure of the silk against your lips preventing words from forming.  “Grrmmphh!”

Your words are not intelligible, even to the gag translator… but that’s partially because you’re not even trying to make words at all.  All you’re doing is grunting, trying to get her attention.

“What’s the matter girl?  Has Tula fallen down a well?”

You shake your head no.  And then you grunt again, and tilt your neck towards some nearby bushes.

“Oh?  Is… is something over there?”

You nod.  Not that there actually *is* anything over there, but if you convince her there is, maybe she – and the other lady, will go to check it out.

Speaking of which, you hear the soft sound of skittering legs as the second woman sets down beside you.

“Zauzyne!  Come quick, there’s something hiding in those bushes!” Merry says.

The newly arrived spider raises an eyebrow, looking right towards you with disbelief. 

“Yeah, sure there is,” she says with a smirk.

“It’s true!” Merry insists.  “My new friend senses it!  Maybe with her nose?  She’s a cute little floofer, so her sense of smell is really strong!”

“Or she’s lying to you,” says Zauzyne.  Merry looks aghast at the notion.  “My friend would *never* lie to me!  Isn’t that right?”

You’re about to grunt a reply, but Zauzyne snatches the gag talk translator away from Merry and smashes it in her hand.

“No more corrupting our sweet, naive little Merry, you scamp,” she says.  All you can do is squirm and grunt helplessly, your one method of interacting with the situation now taken away from you.  “Anyway, let’s get these slaves back to the base, and—”

But she’s cut off by the sound of rustling from the bushes.  The very same bushes you were just trying to distract them towards.  Wait… was there *actually* something there?

“It’s coming from over there!” Zauzyne says, pointing her finger as she gets ready for a fight.

“Aww… what a cutie!” Merry says as it steps forward.  “You’re not a scary monster at all.  You’re just a cute little lizard, aren’t yo—-”

Her voice suddenly cuts off, and you hear a sickening crackling sound emanating from her body.  You look up just in time to see her clothing flake away and her figure transform into dull, gray granite.

“Crap!  It’s—” Zauzyne begins.  But she doesn’t get to finish.]

In a moment she, too, is reduced to being nothing more than an inert hunk of rock.  Whatever did this must be quite the foe indeed.  And given how quickly they petrified, that must mean it transforms them via eyesight.  A gorgon?  No, she said lizard, so probably a basilisk, then.  You’ve certainly been calcified by your fair share of them in your career.  So your instincts kick in and you smartly close your eyes before you end up like the two spiders.

You hear it shuffling towards you, its stubby lizard legs padding slowly against the ground.  Some basilisks can petrify with their fangs as well, or the barbs on their tails.  Is this one going to finish you off?  It’s not like you have much choice in the matter, considering how tightly you’re webbed up.  But the fact that it didn’t emerge until threatened suggests to you that it might not be a predator.  If it’s protecting its territory or acting in self defense, it might leave if you just try to be as non-threatening as possible.

It draws closer, close enough that you can feel its hot, rancid breath on your face.  You put that nose of yours to good use, and can smell residue of plant matter in its stench – it’s an herbivore!  That reassures you as it continues poking and prodding at you, nudging you with its head, slapping you with its tail.  But you remain resolute, keeping your eyes closed fast and not moving an inch.  And, eventually, to your great relief, it plods away, seeing you as something that’s not worth its time.

Once the sounds of its footsteps fade away entirely you finally exhale, and then get to work figuring out how you’re going to untangle yourself from all this silk.

]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="448" name="FE09CG" tags="" position="5475,3075" size="100,100">It takes quite a while to cut yourself free.  It probably would have been impossible, given how thoroughly you’d been webbed up, but one of the culprits of the affair also proves to be your salvation.  Their silk seems incredibly sturdy - much harder to escape from than normal webbing, but you’d noticed all of them seemed perfectly adept at manipulating the stuff and snipping it apart when needed.  Which must mean that their own spider legs must have some kind of property that allows the webbing to be easily severed.  You prove that true by stretching and straining until you’re lined up with one of the petrified arachnids, then using the tips of her own stony legs to slice away at your bindings.

“Thanks for the assist,” you say once you’re finally free, giving Zauzyne’s hardened form a hearty slap with your hand.  A bit too hearty, since your hand stings with pain after the impact.  Even when petrified, spider-ladies always seem to get the better of you.

You look apologetically towards Merry.  “Sorry, cutie.”  She honestly didn’t seem so bad… other than the whole wanting to kidnap you and keep you as a pet for the rest of your life thing.  

But you have other things to worry about than the safety of your kidnappers, because Revissa is still strung up in a spiral net high above the ground.  You fish through your pack for the runic knife Vhaja gave you, then clamber up a tree until you’re even with her.  Revissa grunts weakly, even more bundled up in silk since the last time you saw her… and with an exhausted expression that indicates her captor was having a lot of fun playing with her until she was lured away.  Some tiny, foolish part of you considers taking further advantage of your wife while she’s helpless like this, but the part of you that wants to keep living past today thinks better of it and gets to work setting her free.

It takes a while, but you eventually get it done.  And once most of the silk is off of her, Revissa reverts from her harpy form back to humanoid, almost as if the webbing was keeping her transformation in stasis until it was removed.

“How are you feeling?” you ask, once you help get her back down to the ground.

“Like I was tied up and molested by a spider-woman for nearly an hour,” she replies.

You just grin and pull her into a tight hug.  She melts in your grip, finally letting herself relax.  Though she would never show it to anyone other than you, you know that for all the strength and determination your wife exudes, sometimes she really does like being able to relax in a pair of powerful arms, to feel safe and comfortable and secure.  So you indulge her, holding her tight, stroking her hair and letting the beat of her heart intermingle with your own.  It’s times like this that you remember just how much you love her.

Sadly, the romantic moment is broken up by the sound of a communicator beeping out a message.  You trace the noise to Zauzyne’s feet, where you discover that her device appears to have survived the petrification process that otherwise reduced her garments to crumbled fragments - funny how stuff like this always seems to destroy clothing, isn’t it?  Either way, a voice crackles over the comm, a voice you recognize as belonging to Tula, the red-skinned spider who tried to catch you back at the orchard.

“You there?  I’m guessing you’ve not reported in yet since you caught those cuties and are having your fun.  But the girls back home are getting restless, so hurry up and bring them over to spread the love.”

You and Revissa exchange glances.  Against all odds, you’ve actually managed to avoid the fate of becoming communal sex toys for a colony of lusty spider babes.  But it’s clear at least one of those spiders hasn’t yet given up the chase.

“Hello?  Zauzyne, come on… your sister’s already gone missing.  Don’t tell me you have too!  Answer me dammit!  Ugh… okay, fine, I’m coming after you.  Hold your position.”

Well it looks like the honeymoon is over.  Tula’s back on the hunt, which means it’s time for you to get the heck out of here.  Considering that Merry told you the spider-babes have their home base here in the cliffs, it’s probably a good idea not to stick around in this part of the forest.  And so, after you get dressed back up and properly equipped, you pull out your map and try to figure out the best way to go.

She’s wearing a different outfit now, but that irresistible body of hers still looks the same, even if you know she’s simply pulling images from your mind to base her appearance off of.

“Melfy, you know the drill.  Whatever you do, never agree to play her–”

But Revissa gets cut off when, with a wave of the fae woman’s hand, your wife disappears, and in her place stands a potted tomato plant, its vines curling upwards around her staff which is now plunged into its soil.

“Wha– what?!” you sputter, looking lamely at the suddenly manifested greenery.  “Did… do you turn her into that?”

The woman shrugs, plucking a fruit from the vine and taking a hearty bite from its flesh.  “So, I’m sure you know my deal by now.  Would you like to play my game?”

You look helplessly towards the plant.  “It’s not like I have a choice, right?”

She smiles.  “Oh, there’s always a choice.  But since you’re on the run right now, I’ll make it quick and simple.  You can play my game - a simple game, a fair game, one with equal odds of success or failure - and if you win at it, I’ll give you a boon.  Or you can turn me down, just like your wife would probably like.  If you do that, I’ll bring her back here, and let you both carry on with getting captured by a sexy spider.”

“I mean… it’s… not *guaranteed* that we’re going to get caught by her…” you mumble.

The fae raises an eyebrow.  “You’re welcome to believe that, if it will protect your ego.”  She finishes the rest of the tomato in a single bite, wiping the juice from her lips, then turns towards you and smiles.  “So?  Let’s have your choice.  Game of chance?  Or spider bondage for everyone?”

You take a breath and grit your teeth, trying very hard to change your mental pathways from being terrified of one highly dangerous predator whose abilities you have a pretty good understanding of to another, even *more* dangerous one whose capabilities you couldn’t even guess at.  But eventually, you make your choice.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="450" name="FE08C" tags="" position="4300,3075" size="100,100">It’s a straightforward path from here back to the entrance, but you already know that the route is far more complicated than it appears.  Directions become hazy in this part of the forest, both your map and your senses unreliable thanks to the unseen influence of a lurking threat.

But you’re already managed to overcome that challenge.  You know that you need to stand firm, to trust your mind and not what your eyes are telling you, to keep pushing forward, even if your surroundings stop making sense.  And so, as you draw closer to the ‘danger zone’, you take one last look at your holographic map, committing the route you want to take to memory, since soon that memory is all you’re going to be able to rely on.

Behind you, you suddenly hear the spatter of webbing striking against trees, of silken lines propelling an unseen pursuer towards you, and you realize that the spider-lady you met in the orchard is already hot on your trail.  And despite your knowledge of this area, the woman remains faster than you.  You and Revissa hurry forward, catching sight of shadows from the corner of your eye, of flashes of movement that quickly pass by your periphery.  Before long, you’re sure she’ll be able to catch up with you, but that won’t be a problem if you just make it a little bit further…

This time, it’s not a mire of quicksand, but a sudden windstorm that tries to get in your way.  All your senses are telling you that a powerful hurricane has suddenly swelled up, causing branches to shake and leaves to fall in a whirlwind of colors around you.  Behind you, you hear the spider-lady curse, feel the thump as she loses her grip and falls to the ground.  She doesn’t know to expect this - but you do.  And so, as she struggles with the imaginary wind, you link hands with Revissa and whisper words of reassurance to each other, pressing forwards and ignoring the intensity of the mentally conjured storm.

As before, your diligence pays off.  You push through the illusions, escape the gale-force winds that were never really there.  Before long the sound of it dies down to a gently swirling breeze, and then to nothing at all.  You don’t know what happened to the spider-lady, but the important thing is that she isn’t here.  At this point you finally venture a glance at your map, and find that you’re only a short walk away from the entrance.  You did it!

“And so escape the brave warriors, running recklessly away from the threat of danger,” you say with a sarcastic, self-deprecating smile.

“I’m just surprised you chose to run,” Revissa says, giving you a playfully affectionate slap on the rump.  “I half-expected you to surrender to that spider woman as soon as she appeared.”

“I mean, I was definitely considering it,” you say with a grin.  “Maybe if you’d let me sign up for a membership to that Spider Queen brothel I found on the holonet the other day–”

Revissa’s playful slap becomes more like a full-forced punch as she jabs her fist into your shoulder.  “We’ve gone over this a million times already!  It was clearly a front for a slavery ring!  You’d have been trussed up and spirited away the moment you walked through the door!”

“Sounds like a perfectly reasonable vacation to me,” you say, only half-jokingly.

Your wife sighs.  “Well, if you’re good, maybe we’ll try to find some kind of legit escort service to hire as a Wintermas present this year.”

“Oooh, and then you can gift-wrap me for the occasion!” you say with an eager grin.

“Don’t think that gets you out of *actually* buying me something, though,” your wife counters.  “Tying yourself up in ribbons and laying in a box stops being cute after you do it three years in a row.  Especially when you *know* I’ve been wanting new trellises for the cargo-bay garden…”

You make a mental note to earmark some funds for that after the payout for this mission as the two of you head back to the forest entrance in delightfully high spirits.

[[Exit the forest-&gt;FE07]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="451" name="FE08B" tags="" position="4300,2950" size="100,100">“We need to turn around,” you say grimly.  “This isn’t working.”

“Don’t you have a map?!” Revissa complains.

“I do but… I don’t know.  Something’s off here.”

“If I had time, I’d ask the forest for guidance,” Revissa says, “but I guess we don’t.”

And so she begins to turn around.  Maybe a different route will give better results.  However, just as she makes that declaration, a voice rings out from a tree branch above you.

“Oh, I don’t know… I think you’re both about to have all the time in the world!”

A blast  of webbing shoots out from the darkness, just barely missing as it slaps onto the ground between you.

“Crap - she’s here!” you yell, turning towards your wife.  “We need to move – and fast!  Can you  transform?”

Revissa nods, holding up her staff to weave nature energy around her body.  And then, she starts to shift.  Her torso raises up higher, legs spreading apart and body shifting backwards until she’s moving on four limbs instead of two.

You call this her deer-taur form.  Powerful legs and sturdy cloven hooves provide her with both speed and endurance, making her even faster and more resilient than yourself when it comes to traveling long distances.  Before the pursuing spider lady has the chance to catch up, you hop onto her back, wrapping your arms around her torso as you point out the direction she should move in.

“If you say ‘giddy-up’ I’m going to toss you right off my back,” she says firmly.

“How about ‘git along little doggie’, then?” you venture sweetly.  

She just sighs in annoyance as you gallop through the trees.  But you hardly make any progress at all before you somehow get turned around, finding that you’ve circled back to the very same spot you left from, if the loose strands of webbing glued to the ground are any indication.  

“Oh, you’re back?  That’s great, because I suddenly had a headache trying to follow you,” says that same voice.

Before either of you have a chance to react, powerful lines of silk shoot out from the shadows, striking at Revissa’s legs with a sickening wet slap.  She grunts in surprise, and you feel her knees buckle as the silk forces her down into a kneeling position.

“Ack!” your wife screams, trying to pitch and buck her body to escape the powerful tethers.  Her movements nearly throw you off her back, causing you to grunt out as well.

The voice from above chuckles.  “Watch out, dearie.  You wouldn’t want to hurt your rider, would you?”

More silk flies outwards, catching your legs in such a way to glue your hips in place against Revissa’s back.  You reach for your weapon, but the spider-lady is faster, catching your sword from its holster and tossing it uselessly into the brush.  Only then does she drop down to show herself, admiring the way she’s immobilized both rider and mount.

“Now then… let’s get you two bundled up…”]

It was all too easy for her to defeat you.  You may have been on deer-back, but you’re no trained rider; mounted combat is not your forte.  So the spider was able to capitalize on your awkward position and render you helpless with her webbing.  Now you find yourself completely restrained, stripped of weapons and clothing and cocooned in place atop your wife’s back.  Revissa is equally defeated, unable to get up due to all the silk anchoring her to the forest floor.  The two of you grunt and squirm, writhe angrily and impotently as the spider woman watches with amusement, savoring the sight of your futile struggles.  Like it or not, she’s got you right where she wants you now, and you can’t imagine she’s going to be eager to let you go after the effort she made to catch you.

“As much fun as it is to watch this, I think it’s about time we brought you to your new home, don’t you think?”

You have no choice but to comply as she bustles about with the logistics of transporting you.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="452" name="FE08E" tags="" position="4600,2825" size="100,100">You sigh deeply, massaging your temples in frustration, before you look up at the woman with a resigned frown.

“Yeah, fine.  I’ll play your damn game.”

Her face twists into a delighted smile.  “Oh, I hoped you would.”  She waves her hand, and suddenly, the forest seems to dissolve away around you, like it were a watercolor painting whose colors were being washed off the canvas.  It disorients you for a moment, but eventually the swirl of paint reforms, and you find yourself indoors somehow.

You blink as you look around.  “What *is* this place?”

The building you’re standing in has the appearance of something akin to a curio shop, full of various knick-knacks and antiques.  On one wall, a giant grandmother clock.  Hanging from the ceiling, model airplanes suspended on strings.  In the center of the floor, a marble birdbath.  And yet, upon closer inspection, everything within the room has a macabre secret to it - because every single one hides the form of a helpless woman, trapped or transformed by the fae’s wicked magic.  Behind the glass of the clock, a tsunojian is shackled in place, the pendulum tick-tocking between her two heaving breasts.  And within the seats of the airplanes are tiny, glossy pilots, kemomi women shrunken and transformed to forever operate the controls.  And the basin of the birdbath, of course, is clutched between the fingers of a petrified elvaan, the placid smile etched onto her face belying the terror she must have felt in the moment her fate was sealed.

“My secret lair,” the fae woman says, twitching a finger to cause a fountain of water to erupt from the lips of the petrified woman holding the birdbath, making liquid start to collect in the basin.  “My home away from home - and most importantly, it’s where I keep all of my… stuff.”

You feel a shiver run down your spine.  “I… assume that means me, if I lose at your game?”

“Of course.”

Looking around, you realize that there doesn’t seem to be a front door to the strange shop, just a curtain leading into a back room.  Though there is at least a window.  Looking out of it, you see the trees of a forest spreading out into the distance, but somehow you don’t think it’s the same forest you were just standing in.  Trying to escape at this point seems like an even more foolish idea than agreeing to come here in the first place.

“Okay…” you say with another sigh.  “So what’s the game?”

The fae woman grins.  “Like I said, it’s incredibly simple.  A game of chance, of the most basic variety.  We’re going to flip a coin.  If you guess what side it lands on, you get a reward.  If you guess wrong, I get you.  Sound fair?”

“I… am going to assume that the reward I get is you giving me back my wife?”

Your hostess assumes a look of mock offense.  “You wound me, my little wolf.  I don’t need to give you your wife back, because you’ve already got her.”  She pauses a beat, savoring the look of confusion on your face.  “Check your pocket.”

“My pockets?”  Nervously, you stick your hands in your pockets, feeling around for anything unusual.  You mostly just find bits of lint and a couple of leaves that must have fallen in there while walking through the forest, but when you get to the one on your right butt cheek, you feel something hard and heavy inside that certainly wasn’t there before.  When you pull it out, you find the object to be both shocking yet completely expected.

Revissa’s face looks back at you, a blank, neutral expression in her eyes.  She’s nothing but an etching illustrated on the face of a gold coin, though whether she’s been physically converted into the object, or if her spirit was just somehow drawn into it as a receptacle is anyone’s guess.

“Try the other side,” your hostess says with a grin.  And so you do]

Now you’re looking at your wife’s adorable posterior.  You can just make out the sight of her hands folded in front of her through the gap in her legs, and when you run your finger over the coin, you can feel a slight texture in the etching of her tail, almost as if it were an approximation of soft fur.

“So… that’s it?” you ask. “I just flip it – flip *her* – in the air, and call heads or tails?”

“That’s right.”

“And if I guess wrong, you keep me.”

“Yup.”

“But if I win… I get a reward?”  Remembering how things went last time with the merry-go-round race, you decide to really iron out the details in the event of your victory right now.  “So you said I get a boon.  Obviously, I want Revissa turned back to normal.  But I think I deserve something more than that, given how I already beat you once and you’re forcing me into a rematch.”

“I didn’t force you into anything,” the fae woman says, idly swishing her hands through her hair.  “But I suppose you’re right.  What do you propose if you win?”

You think about it for a while.  “If I win… I get to set a rule,” you say.  “Something that you have to abide by, no matter what.”

“Oh?” she raises an eyebrow.  “That’s a dangerous thing for one such as me to agree to.”

“Yeah, well it’s a dangerous thing to play a game where I have a 50% chance of becoming a bauble in your collection,” you assert.  “If you don’t agree, you can just turn Revissa back and kick us out if you want.”

She thinks for a long moment.  “Hrm… I will agree on one condition.  Any rule you propose must apply to you and me equally.  So if you were to, say, make the rule ‘you must remain a stone statue for the next 1000 years,’ then you and I will be sharing a pedestal for a few centuries together.”

“Done.”  Maybe a foolish thing to agree to, but you figure it’s the best you’re going to get.  You hold out your hand, and the fae woman eagerly shakes it.

“Wonderful,” the woman says.  “Though of course it goes without saying, any attempt to cheat - either from you, or from the folks playing along at home - will result in immediate forfeit.  Do you hear me?  That means you, $yourname!(if: $cheater is true)[Though I suppose you&#39;ve already learend that lesson if you&#39;re reading this, haven&#39;t you?]”

Not like you’d be able to cheat anyway.  The coin is pretty huge, and you don’t have another one to swap it out for.  

“Well… I guess this is it,” you say, holding the metal disc tightly between your fingers.

“Oohh… I’m so excited!  Go ahead and flip it!  And for those of you at home, rest assured, I’m playing fair.  This game has a random-number function, and that’s what we’re using to pick which side is the winner.  So, win or lose, please accept the results, and don’t blame me if you’re forced to redo a bunch of gameplay as a result.”

You ignore her perplexing rambling as you toss your wife in the air, then prepare to call out the choice that will decide your fate.

“Actually, there was a 50% chance it could have gone well for you,” she counters.  “But I guess you’d prefer 0% instead.  Oh well.”

She snaps her fingers, and suddenly the forest begins to shift around you.  You feel an odd sensation of vertigo, even though you’re pretty sure you’re not moving at all, and hear a sudden chorus of grunts and groans as a number of other people seem to appear around you, each of them caught up in the same whirlwind of pseudo-motion.  It gets to the point that you start to black out, though, just as your vision goes dark, you hear the fae woman whisper breathily in your ear.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="454" name="FE08G" tags="" position="4600,3075" size="100,100">(if: $faepromise is true)[Screw this.  You’re not going to let this lady boss you around any more.  Spiders and forests, magic and monsters, tricks and traps, you’re done letting all this crap push you around!  You’ve already beaten her twice now, and yet she *still* persists in terrorizing you.  So maybe it’s time to give her a beat-down that she won’t soon forget.

At least, that’s what you’d *like* to do.  But as soon as you grab your sword and prepare to charge, you suddenly find your body going stiff.  Muscles lock in place, limbs refuse to move, every nerve ending numbing as you become overwhelmed with some kind of paralysis.

“Unnf – wha?” you murmur.

As you stand there lamely, the fae woman slinks over, running a finger seductively down your arm.  “Aww, what’s wrong, little wolfie?  You seem… tense.”

You growl and snarl, but nothing other than your lips moves at your command.  She just chuckles as she gently brushes her hand through your hair, pinching the fuzz between your ears.

“My, you’re certainly angry today.”

“Can you blame me?” you snap back.  “You keep showing up to bother me.”

She grins and moves in closer, pressing her chest against your side.  “Maybe that’s just because there’s something I find… irresistible about you.”

You try to pull away, but your body refuses to move.  “Also, you’ve turned my wife into a tomato plant.”

The fae woman adopts a mock expression of offense.  “Now why would you think that?  Sure, she’s disappeared, and sure, now there’s a plant where she was standing, but that doesn’t mean she’s been transformed into anything.”

“If that’s the case, then bring her back,” you say.

She tilts her head to the side, putting a finger to her lip playfully.  “Hrm… I suppose I could.  But I think I want something from you first.  You see, we’ve been having our fun, you and I.  But I think the game can get a bit more… heated, don’t you?”

Her mouth is an inch from your ear when she says this, her breath hot and heavy.  Despite the situation, you can’t help but feel turned on by it.

“No way,” you protest, forcing down your arousal.  “There’s not a universe where agreeing to that plays out well for me.”

“Aww… you’re such a party pooper,” she says with a frown.  “But that’s okay.  I have methods to deal with strapping young women who refuse my advances…”

She raises her hand, and you can see she’s about to snap her fingers to do some magic.  And in that instant, your instincts tell you it is time to react.

“Mira!” you yell, the moment before her spell goes off.  You don’t know much about the fae, but the one thing that all the stories agree on is that knowing their name gives you some amount of power over them.  Shouting out hers does seem to have that effect.  She stops what she’s doing, hand still raised in the air, and looks at you curiously.

“Yes?” she says bemusedly.  “What is it?”

You narrow your eyes.  “I won your game before and guessed your name.  And when we parted, I withheld payment on my prize.”

“I remember,” she says.

“Well now I’m going to cash that in.  As my prize for winning… I want you to turn that spell you were about to cast on me back on yourself, and suffer the full effects of it.”

She giggles.  “Really?  That’s all you want from my boon?”

“Yes, that’s what I want.”

“Well, if you insist…”

And then she finishes the motion and snaps her fingers.  A puff of pink energy appears around her hand when it finishes, forming into a cloud of hazy dust that wafts in the air around her.  She takes a moment to examine it before, with a playful wink in your direction, she takes a deep breath and inhales.  The mist flows past her lips and gives her face a rosy glow, makes her eyes light up with a deep, hungry pleasure.

“This could have been for you, little wolfie.  But I guess you’d just prefer to watch instead of participate.”

She reaches out and boops you on the nose.  And it is at this point that you realize you’re still completely paralyzed.  Well, crap.  You were hoping when she got distracted by her lust spell she’d release her hold on you.

“Wait, I–”

But she just makes a shushing motion, twirling her finger and doing something that seems to pull the breath out from beneath your lips.  And now, when you try to form words, all that happens is you open and close your mouth confusedly, producing no sound.

“You could have had fun with me.  But you traded in your boon, and made your choice.  So I guess I’ll just be going solo.”

And then with a flick of her wrist, her clothing vanishes from her body, revealing the shapely contours of her figure to your eyes.  You desperately feel the need to run your hands over her alluring curves, but you remain rooted to the spot, unable to do anything but watch as she begins to finger herself greedily.

“Oooohh…” she moans.  “So terrible.  Trapped in a powerful lust spell and forced to pleasure myself until completion.  Helplessly distracted by my arousal, unable to do anything but submit to the sensations as my captive audience watches in front of me.”

*Yeah, yeah, rub it in*, you think bitterly.  You were really hoping that your ploy would turn out differently.  But it seems like you’re out of luck.

…or are you?  Because as you stand there, frozen in place, your ears pick up a sound coming from behind you.  A rustling in the bushes nearby.  Is someone else here?

Your instinct would have been to turn around and face the threat.  But in this case, it’s probably a good thing that you couldn’t.  Because instead of you that lays eyes on your visitor, it’s Mira.  And when she does, her line about being helpless until she finishes masturbating proves to be entirely accurate.

The sound is like ice being dropped into a glass of water, a crickle-crackle of stone spreading across warm, naked flesh.  You’re treated to a front-row seat to her transformation, allowing you to watch as the wave of granite starts from her feet and quickly works its way up.  Still trapped in the spell you redirected towards her, the reality of the situation does not even register in her half-lidded eyes.  All she can do is succumb to the effects of the visitor’s cursed gaze and become reduced to an inert hunk of stone in the space of a few moments.

Your body regains its mobility the moment she becomes completely petrified.  As soon as it does, your first instinct is to close your eyes tightly and let your now-loosened limbs give out beneath you and drop you to the ground.  Based on the sounds of its shuffling feet and the smell of its body, you’re pretty sure it’s a basilisk that you’re dealing with here.  Unlike, say, a gorgon, a basilisk is just a regular animal, operating only on bestial instincts.  So hopefully, if you show that you’re not a threat to it, it will leave without a confrontation.

Thankfully, your gut proves right in this instance.  It draws closer, close enough that you can feel its hot, rancid breath on your face.  You put that nose of yours to good use, and can smell residue of plant matter in its stench – it’s an herbivore!  That reassures you as it continues poking and prodding at you, nudging you with its head, slapping you with its tail.  But you remain resolute, keeping your eyes closed fast and not moving an inch.  And, eventually, to your great relief, it plods away, seeing you as something that’s not worth its time.

Only after the sound of its footsteps fade away completely do you finally get up and open your eyes.

The fae woman waves her hand, and a berry bush appears right where the charging kemomi warrior had been an instant earlier.  She sighs, takes a moment to adjust her hair, and then turns to look out towards the screen you’re viewing this on.

“Come on, really?  You knew that wasn’t going to work.  Please stop making poor Melfy throw herself into unwinnable situations, just to see what will happen.  I almost feel bad for the girl.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="455" name="FE08DB" tags="" position="4450,2950" size="100,100">As you slowly come back to your senses, you find yourself lying naked on cold, damp stone.  The air is musty and stale, and it’s nearly pitch dark around you, the only light coming from the subtle phosphorescent glow of some odd-looking mushrooms.  You’re underground, you reason, in some kind of cave system.

And you’re alone.  Still feeling weak and disoriented, you pull yourself to your feet and stumble forward, searching for an exit from the cavern.  Your mind is a muddled mess, but you recall you were in the forest not too long ago, and remember the sound of many voices caught up in some kind of maelstrom around you.  But other than that… you’re drawing a blank.  Thanks to your nose, you’re able to sniff your way towards fresher air at least, so you navigate towards the exit of the caves, trying to piece together what the heck just happened.  

Eventually you feel a breeze coming from just around a corner, but when you round the bend, your face collides with another kind of roundness.

“Jyumon?” you murmur in confusion.  Your foxy crew member is tightly bundled up, completely enmeshed in silk.

“Mmmph!” she mewls weakly into her gag.

That at least jogs your memory.  You were fleeing through the forest from a spider lady, trying to make it back to the edge of the woods, when – right!  Something else showed up – that damn fae woman, who turned Revissa into a potted plant!

Except… as you tilt your gaze towards the cavern entrance, you find that memory is no longer true.  Because…]

|drink1)[(link:&quot;Find your wife&quot;)[(show:?drink2)]]

|drink2)[&lt;img src=&quot;images/F100_RevissaCaveWebbed_by_DeerBundle.png&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;(css: &quot;font-size: 60%&quot;)[Art by DeerBundle(click-replace: &quot;Art by DeerBundle&quot;)[https://www.deviantart.com/deerbundle

Revissa is wrapped up as well, strung in front of the entrance as if to serve as a warning to anyone trying to slip in.  She wriggles and squirms, completely caught, helpless to do anything to protect herself.

So she’s not a plant…?  You try to remember the encounter with the fae woman.  She made you an offer… but you turned her down.  After that she seemed annoyed, but also… very confident that your decision would still result in your failure. What was it she said?  That you *are* about to get tangled up with someone, and… to say hello to your friends.

At the moment of that realization, several things happen at once.  First, it occurs to you that as punishment, the fae woman must have transported you and the rest of your crew here into these caverns without equipment or clothing, to be preyed upon by the spider women who call this place home.  Second, you figure out that Revissa hasn’t been positioned at the entrance as a warning, but as a distraction!  Because if you focus on her wiggling around, right when you’re about to get out of here, you won’t notice something dropping down from above you.  And third, you realize that you spent too much time putting together the first two conclusions, because it’s already too late to escape the consequences of the third.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="456" name="FE08DC" tags="" position="4450,3075" size="100,100">It’s all over so quickly.  She was right where you thought she’d be, lurking in the shadowy corners of the cavern, just waiting to pounce.  And once the opportunity presents itself she takes it, leaping down on top of you and pinning you to the ground.  To your credit, you manage to defend yourself, thrashing and kicking, biting and scratching, but all you manage to do is rip a tear in her clothing before she manages to subdue.  And then you feel yourself spinning round and round as she winds her webs about your figure, stripping away your clothing with the pointed ends of her back legs at the same time

“I can’t believe it!” she says, slathering your lips with a silken gag to finish capturing you.  “There I was, wandering all over the forest looking for the cuties who escaped, but somehow you all ended up right here in our home.”

So this was what the fae woman meant.  By refusing to play her game, she condemned you to enslavement at the hand of the lusty spider-babes.  And not just you.  The rest of your crew ended up here as well.  And they’re next on her shopping list.

“Now sit tight, because I’ve already picked up on some more cuties wandering around that need to join you.”

Once she’s finished bundling you up, she slaps you against a wall and glues you in place.  Though as a consolation prize, when she surveys the damage you did to her clothing, she decides it would be easier to just ditch her outfit completely rather than try to make repairs.  So you’re treated to the sight of a naked spider babe as she skitters back to the ceiling to wait for more prey.
Vhaja is the next to show up.  Just like with how you got distracted by Revissa, she momentarily pauses at the sight of Jyumon all wrapped up, and that’s the only opportunity the huntress needs to spring down and scoop her up.  It’s only minutes later, just after she’s done suspending the captive Elvaan from the ceiling, that Krysta shows up, trying - and failing - to sneak up behind the bewitching arachnid.  Your red-headed friend is snared instantly, reduced to a squirming bundle without getting a single shot off from her blaster.

The last one to fall is Lumina.  She wanders into the room shortly after Krysta does, nervously peering into the dark corners of the cave, not noticing the shadow descending from above.

Like the rest of you, she succumbs to the touch of silk, bundled up by the lusty spider woman as the rest of you watch helplessly from your respective perches.  She can’t do anything as a hand ravenously squeezes against her breast, as the spider woman whispers into her ear all the lewd things that are going to be done to her now that she, along with her friends, have been reduced to immobilized slaves.  Everyone’s caught, which means there’s no one left to enact a rescue.  No matter how you look at it, it seems your adventure has come to an end

Though a new one is just beginning.  After she’s done indulging herself with you and your friends, your captor invites a bunch of *her* friends over, a bevy of spider babes of the same species as she is – and all of them with equally active libidos.  She explains to the group that the six of you are going to be registered as communal property, that you’re going to be installed as permanent sex toys out here in the hallways of the cave system to be used freely by anyone who wants the opportunity to blow off some steam.  Her announcement proves to be quite good for morale.  Well, for the spiders’ morale.  You and your crew can only fall into despair as you realize just how thoroughly you’ve been defeated.

But that doesn’t mean that you don’t scream.  The spider-women prove to be just as adept at giving you pleasure as using you all to elicit it for themselves.  They go on for hours, taking turns, swapping one slave out for another, each of them eager to have a go at every one of their new toys.  It feels like days have passed before any of you get even the slightest moment of reprieve. 

Their leader said you were communal property, and the community just continues to grow as more and more spider women flock from every corner of the galaxy to join the colony and partake of its amenities.  Over time, more cocooned captives are brought in to line the winding halls of the cavern, and their muffled grunts of pleasure echo across the stone non-stop, mingling with those of you and your friends.  You feel bad for them, of course, but also somewhat thankful, since more options for the sex slave buffet means each individual course of the meal has more time to marinate unmolested.

Whatever enterprise the spider women are engaging in here seems to be quite successful.  Successful enough that they gain power, influence, and wealth on the galactic stage, enough that there’s never any danger of their settlement being overtaken.  Sadly, what that means for you and the other slaves is that rescue never comes.  And thanks to the properties of the planet’s Ghost Matter, woven into the fibers of your silken cocoons, it also means you’ll be able to stay like this forever.  You’ll never need to eat or sleep, never grow tired, never age a day, meaning that for the rest of your lives, you’ll be the perfect sex toys to slake the endless lust of your new owners.

If only you’d just played that damn fae woman’s game, you often think to yourself.  At least you’d have had a chance to avoid this fate.  But you made your choice and she punished you for it, and now there’s nothing left to do but accept that you and your friends will be paying for that decision for the rest of your lives.

This continues for many years.  Thanks to the properties of the planet’s Ghost Matter woven into the fibers of your cocoons, you never need to eat or sleep, and never age a day, meaning that you look more or less the same as when you were first captured as you do when you’re finally released.  It’s all because of that Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed ages ago at the start of your adventure that a passing Scout happens to pick up on the distress signal and come in to investigate.  Though she’s not able to free you immediately, she does secure a deal with the spider-women that after a hundred years they’ll finally release you.

By the time you and your friends finally get to move again, the galaxy is much changed from how you remember it.  Surely, it will hold many adventures for you and your friends now, but that’s a different story than this one.  Maybe if you’d just played that fae woman’s game, all those years ago, things would have turned out differently, but that’s not the reality you currently occupy.  Needless to say, whatever you get up to now, you’ve still completely failed your mission.

GAME OVER

For a moment you just stare at it in confusion, before turning and raising an eyebrow at the fae woman.

“Yes, yes, that was me.  But I have a good reason for it,” she says with a grin.  “Look, I know you folks at home have your own lives, and you don’t want to waste precious seconds clicking on blue letters to try to unlock sexy pictures.  And while adding an element of randomness is fun, it can get old quickly.  I’m not so cruel that I’d let you get all the way up to this point multiple times, then give you the ending you hadn’t seen yet anyway.  So, here’s what I’m going to do.  I’ll tell you straight up, that the coin is going to land on $coin.  Up to you if you choose to believe me, of course, but I have no reason to lie.  After all, even if you beat me, I’m only losing in a single timeline, and there’s a hundred more where I don’t.  Regardless, anti-cheating measures are still in effect, so please don&#39;t do anything foolish.”

Then she snaps her fingers again, and the coin starts to move once more… and you can’t remember a thing that she just said.  But you don’t have time to dwell on that, since you need to call the flip now before the coin lands!

You can hardly believe it!  You look down at the coin, marveling at the simplicity of it all.  

“I… won?” you murmur in confusion.  

The fae woman chuckles.  “I did say it was a fair game, didn’t I?  Which means you were equally as likely to win as you were to lose.”

“Yeah, but… I just kind of thought you’d have rigged it or something,” you admit.

“Me?  Never!  I am a woman with an impeccable moral compass,” the fae says, lying brazenly.  “What’s wrong?  Were you hoping to see the Game Over scenario first?  I warn you, I wouldn’t recommend it.  You need to abide by the results of what happened, even if you *wanted* to lose.”

You scratch your head.  It’s not like you wanted to lose… though you admit you’re a bit curious as to what she would have done if you had.

“Anyway, rules are rules, and fair is fair, so you’re owed a boon, I believe?” the fae says, flicking her finger to once again perform her magic.

All at once, the curio shop fades away, and you’re assaulted by a vertigo-inducing sensation of not-quite-motion, shifting between one plane of reality to another.  When it finally stops, you’re back in the forest on Spectra I again … and Revissa is once more hale and hearty by your side!

“Are you okay?” you yell, running over to her.

Your wife shivers for a moment, and then starts patting at her backside.

“Yes… I’m fine.  But why does it feel like someone’s been groping my butt?”

“Err… it’s a long story.”

The fae woman claps her hands to get your attention.  “Anyway, girls, I don’t have all day (that’s a lie, $yourname, but we don’t need to let them know that), so why don’t you tell me about that boon of yours, yes?”

Revissa narrows her eyes at you.  “Don’t tell me - did you agree to yet another one of her games!”

You throw your arms up in the air.  “I had no choice!”

“There’s always a choice!” Revissa protests.

“She said we’d be guaranteed to be captured by spiders if I didn’t play,” you counter.

Though… speaking of spiders.  Weren’t you in the process of running away from one just now?  You nervously glance around the area… and then happen to spot a shadow nestled in the branches of a nearby tree.  Well, crap, it looks like she’s found you.  Any moment now, she’ll be sure to pounce.  Though… you can’t help but notice that the fae lady is standing between you and her.  And that gives you a wicked little idea…

You look towards the fae and smile.  “So, you said I get to propose a rule, right?” you say.  “And the only condition is that it applies to both of us equally?”

“That’s right,” the woman says.

“In that case… the rule is thus: **Both of us are equally helpless at escaping from spider-silk cocoons**”

She raises an eyebrow.  “Wait, whaa—--- aaaaack!”

Just like you predicted, the spider-woman pounces.  But her first target is the one that was closest to her.  The fae lady sails through the air in an instant, falling into the arachnids arms and getting spun around quick as can be.  She’s cocooned with such speed and talent it’s hard to even follow, but sure enough, when it’s done, she’s strung up and helpless, exactly as you would be if your positions were reversed.

You’d love to stay and appreciate the view, but you know better than to press your luck.  So you grab Revissa’s hand and make your escape while she’s still distracted by her latest catch.  Though you’ve got to figure out which way to run.  At this point, you’ve already decided the cliffs are too dangerous.  You’re in the center of the forest right now, but surely if you keep going this way, she’s eventually going to catch up.  So that just leaves one more viable route.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="462" name="FE08EB" tags="" position="4750,2825" size="100,100">“Um… best two out of three?” you ask with a nervous smile.

The fae woman smiles right back.  “Sure!  But… I’m going to need another coin to flip.”

And then she snaps her fingers.  A strange sense of dizziness and vertigo overtakes you as the surroundings of the curio shop start to suddenly grow.  No… it’s not that the shop is growing, it’s that you’re getting smaller!

You feel your clothing fall away from your body as it becomes too big to fit you, cascading downwards in a waterfall of flowing cloth.  By the time you’re done shrinking, you’re practically buried in your fallen outfit and have to burrow your way out of it.  When you finally emerge back into the air of the shop, you’re momentarily blinded by the light from the lamp on a table towering high above you (a lamp in the shape of a woman, you can’t help but notice).  In your disorientation, you stumble backwards, slamming against some sort of cold, hard, metal disc.

“Ack!” you yell out, trying to scramble away from the object, but you find your skin stuck to it, almost as if by magnetic force.  “What the heck?”

The fae woman’s laugh, coming from high above you, sounds like an earthquake, the vibrations of her voice making your body shiver merely from the force of the soundwaves.

“Like I said… I need another coin,” she rumbles, bending down to show your reflection in a hand mirror (the handle of which is also woman-shaped) gripped in her palm.

And that’s when you realize what fate has befallen you.  While stumbling around you backed up against a thin metal disc made of gold, probably about ten inches high, though it’s hard to tell the relative length of things when you’ve changed so much in size.  But now you’re stuck to that disc, arms and legs flailed out embarrassingly, held in place as the golden color from the surface of the object starts to spread across your own skin!

“Wha… no!  Come on!  This, this isn’t–”

The fae woman lets out a cascading chuckle.  “You lost the flip, but that’s no reason to flip out.  Though you *will* be getting flipped, over and over and over again…”

And that’s when you finally realize this isn’t just a metal disc, it’s a gold coin, and you’re becoming fused with it!  Looking at your reflection, you can see your body getting partially submerged into the coin, not turned into an etching like Revissa, but more like a relief, embossed inside the circular structure.  But at the same time, you’re also transforming into gold, your skin numbing whenever the glittering metal passes over your body.  

Sadly, there’s nothing you can do to stop it, so after a few seconds, the sensation fully eclipses your body.  The last thing you see before your vision goes blank is the blue pupils of your eyes turning a lustrous yellow, completing your transformation.

“Wonderful!” the fae woman says, though you can no longer hear her.  But you can still *feel* it as she picks you up, her fingers rubbing themselves all over the protruding parts of your golden body.  And you can sense a rush of movement as you’re tossed through the air, of spinning swiftly, of landing, of a hand slapping down on your golden frame.

“Heads!”  the fae woman yells, then flips you again.  “And heads again!  Looks like I win!”

She holds the coin up in front of her face, appreciating her trophy, then sets it down on a table right next to her other new acquisition.

Third, as punishment, I’m removing all the story checkpoints you’ve earned up until now.  You’ll have to start over from the very beginning and work your way back to this point.

What that means is the moment I turned you to stone, I created a splinter reality rather than alter the existing one.  So, rest assured, there’s now an alternate universe where you’ve been reduced to nothing but a mere sculpture (and your body was transformed into your ideal self-image right before it happened, because I’m nice like that).  In that universe, a lot of people are going to be quite confused, because petrification isn’t exactly a normal occurrence there.  Maybe they’ll put you in a museum or something.

Of course, since you’re still reading this, clearly it didn’t, and you’re free to go on living your life thinking this is just a silly browser game, and not a window which an incredibly powerful manipulator of reality occasionally steals glimpses through.  I’ve got to say - your universe is awfully boring.  Can’t one of you at least invent a freeze ray, or genetically breed actual giant spiders or something?

Your slumber is only broken up by occasional flashes of action, when the world again spins for you, when your function as a coin is utilized to settle matters of chance.  These are the moments you live for now, the only purpose you have.  It’s hard to tell when you forget that you used to be a person.  Your life from before seems so far away now.

But of course, there’s another function to coins other than flipping.  You’re also a unit of currency.  And that aspect comes into play some time in the future, when your owner is in the midst of a tense poker game with some other extra-planar entities.

“Raise,” she says, sliding a wolf and a deer across the table to join the pile of valuables in the pot.  Her opponent matches the ante, and then calls for the end of the round of betting.  When everyone reveals their cards, it turns out the opponent has the better hand, and gleefully rakes the whole set of winnings onto their side of the table.

For you, it’s a wonderful sense of motion.  Especially when you’re dropped into a bag, and Revissa’s coin happens to land right on top of yours.  It’s almost like you’re kissing!

And then… you’re forgotten about.  No one ever comes back to claim you.  You’re never needed again, not for flipping, not for paying, not for anything.  In the end, your whole life just amounted to a tiny increase in the ledgers of some unfathomable being that exists outside of time and space.  

If there’s one tiny silver lining to your endless golden existence, it’s that you can feel Revissa laying right beside you.  So at least you’ll both always be together, even if no one will ever be thinking of you again.

She purchases the coin and its neighbor and manages to get the two of you restored - though it’s been hundreds of years since you were first transformed.  And so you find yourself stepping into a galaxy that has changed immensely since you were last a part of it.  An exciting new adventure, to be sure, but also rather outside the scope of this one.

Of course, it also goes without saying, but you failed the mission you were initially hired to complete.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="467" name="FE04H" tags="" position="1850,2550" size="100,100">You continue on for quite some time through the river, making good progress towards the entrance and what you hope is the relative safety of the open fields outside the forest.  But as you move with the flow, you remember something.  The river goes past the Knottie outpost you encountered earlier in your quest.  And last you checked, Ros’eela was still there.  It would be wrong to just leave her, especially with this spider lady prowling the area.    {Sure, she’s frozen and mounted on a wall at the moment, but that just means she wouldn’t even be able to fend for herself if the arachnid predator decided she’d look better hanging from *her* wall, instead.}  No matter how you slice it, you decide the right thing to do would be to head back there.

And so you give Revissa a tug on her fin and point towards the surface of the water, indicating you’d like to pop back up to have a chat.

“What’s wrong?” she asks, her mermaid face bobbing above the water.  Luckily, the magic that transformed her makes her equally adept at breathing in air as she is with water while in this shape.

“We should check in on the outpost again,” you say.  “It’s not fair to leave Ros’eela behind while there’s a predator wandering the area.”

Revissa sighs, but eventually nods her head in agreement.  “Alright.  Help me out onto the shore and I’ll change back.”

One downside to her mermaid form is that it’s not particularly convenient for her to revert to a humanoid while underwater; suddenly losing gills in the middle of doing magic can be very disorienting, not to mention a drowning hazard.  So you climb out first, then offer a hand to your wife to remove her from the river.  She accepts it and allows you to pull her up, then slowly makes the motions to return herself to her normal shape.  

“Let’s just hope Ros’eela is more reasonable than you are,” Revissa says once she’s finished, and the two of you start walking towards the outpost.

You raise an eyebrow.  “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“I mean, she might be excited by the prospect of getting webbed up and intentionally surrender herself.”

That gives you pause.  “Hey wait… is that an option?  Because I mean, a few years as a webbed up sex slave wouldn’t be so ba—ow!”

You yell as Revissa angrily knees you in the rump.  “Fine, fine, no getting caught intentionally,” you say.  By now, the buildings of the settlement are coming into view.  

Unfortunately, something else is as well.

The webbing flies out from a direction you weren’t expecting, catching you on the chest and sending you careening backwards onto the forest floor.

“Damnit!” Revissa yells, holding out her staff to begin the incantation for a spell.  But she doesn’t get the chance to finish it before the spider pounces on her from above.  A moment later, and she’s in no position to do anything at all.

Plaintive grunts pour out from her gagged lips, the only sound she can make as she desperately searches for a way to escape.  But she can’t find one – and neither can you.

By the time you recover from the spider-woman’s sneak attack, peeling off the glob of silk stuck to your chest, she’s finished wrapping up Revissa and is ready to move on to you.  You’d love to say you put up a good fight before she caught you, but it would be a lie.  In a moment, you’re just as helpless as your wife.]

The two of you exchange helpless glances, both of you equal parts annoyed and humiliated that you’d forgotten to keep your voices down.  But there’s nothing to do about it now.  You’re both caught and cocooned, and utterly powerless to do anything about it.

Once she’s done playing with your bodies, the spider lady takes a step towards the abandoned outpost and surveys its layout.

“Hrmm… not bad,” she says.  “I mean, it’s no space yacht, but it’s better than a bunch of dreary old caves, at least.  I just hope there’s someplace good for storing slaves.”

And then she slings each of your wriggling forms over a shoulder and has herself a look around.

“Now… hang tight, you two.  But I’ve got another cutie I need to pick up.”

And then she skitters away.  You and Revissa wriggle about for a good twenty minutes, but make absolutely no progress in escaping.  By the time the spider woman returns, you’re both exhausted, with nothing to show for your efforts.  

“I’m back!  And I brought company!”

She’s got the fae woman slung over her shoulder, wiggling just as helplessly as you had been.  Well, it’s nice to know she’s following the rule you set for her.  Though it doesn’t really do you much good as she glued in place beside you.]

“That’ll do.  This place doesn’t seem so bad.  And now we’ve even got some… entertainment.”

She cups the fae woman’s breasts, eliciting a weak moan from the bundled up captive.  Perhaps the rule you forced on her also makes her share in your fetish for this kind of stuff?  And it might just be your imagination, but has her chest grown even larger since the last time you saw it?

“But… I do think we could do with some more.  We’ve got a lot of horny girls back in the caves.”

After a moment of thought, she skitters over to you, and slices away the silk that was wound over your mouth.

“Oh, my name is Tula, but the way.  I’m your new owner, and you’re my new slave.”

You do your best to flash her a smile.  “Nice to meet you, I’m Me–”

“I don’t care what your name is, slave,” she says, cutting you off by pressing the pointed tip of one of her back legs against your cheek.  “But I have noticed that you seem fairly knowledgeable about this place.  So… maybe you know where I can find some more cuties for my collection?  Lead me to enough of them and maybe I’ll hang you up somewhere with a better view.”

Okay, this might be your chance.  Maybe you can use her desire for more slaves against her.  But is there anyone who you could tell her about that would be of any help?

This isn’t… entirely true, you know.  Because when you and Revissa were here before, it tried to trap you in quicksand, and that’s not something you’ve ever been particularly concerned about.  Action heroes from the cartoons and movies you used to watch as a kid seemed to run into quicksand pretty often, but now that you’re a seasoned adventurer you’ve learned it’s not nearly as common a threat as you’d been led to believe.  Now, *spiders* on the other hand…

“Hah!” Tula scoffs.  “How unlucky for it, because I’m not afraid of anything!”

You nod.  “That’s good.  But if you *were* afraid of something, you’d have to be very careful not to think about it.  Otherwise it could be really bad for you.”

Hopefully this will work.  Generally speaking, the best way to get someone to think about something is to tell them *not* to think about it.  So if she *does* have something that she’s afraid of…

Tula’s face suddenly wrinkles in consternation.  “Do… do you smell that?” she asks.

You take a whiff of the air.  Huh, actually, you *do* smell something.  Or at least, the illusions are telling you that you do.  Is that… coconut?

“No!  Why would that – this isn’t even a tropical climate!  How could it – ack!”

She doubles over, holding her chest like she’s got a stomach cramp.  Could it be?  Is her fear that she’s… allergic to coconut?

“You know, I *did* take some scans earlier, and found that some of the berry bushes here bore fruit with a surprisingly similar chemical composition to coconut” you lie, smiling devilishly.

The spider woman groans.  “Ugggggh, damnit!  I have to— urrrrk.”

She turns around and starts running for cover, looking like she’s about to have a violent bowel movement.  But before she gets too far she suddenly gets a placid, far-away look in her eyes, and falls to the ground.  Before long, she’s curled herself into a ball and fallen asleep, just like the Knottie and the other spider-lady from earlier.  Score another victory for the fearsome predator!

Though… unlike last time, your equipment isn’t anywhere nearby.  So how are you going to cut yourself free?  Thankfully, she didn’t tether you in place to anything, so after some effort you’re able to wiggle and squirm up the side of a tree to get yourself onto your feet.  Presumably, you could bend your knees and hop to get around and eventually make it back to where you were caught and cocooned to reclaim your knife.  But that’s going to take forever.  Maybe you should try searching for something other than a knife?

That is entirely untrue, of course.  Because when you and Revissa were here before, it tried to trap you in quicksand, and that’s not something you’ve ever been particularly hot and bothered by.  Now, *spiders* on the other hand…

Tula raises a disbelieving eyebrow.  “Really?  Then why did I just get slammed to the ground by a windstorm?  Does it think I’m a tornado chaser or something?”

“Erm… no, not exactly,” you sputter, trying to think of a worthwhile lie.  “It’s just that it gets stronger the hornier you are, so…”

“Horny?  I can’t say I was particularly aroused by our little excursion,” Tula replies.

You feign embarrassment.  “Erm… it wasn’t *you* who was horny…”

The spider woman processes that for a moment, and then bursts out laughing.  “You really enjoy being kidnapped that much, do you?”  

“Only when the kidnapper is as gorgeous as you are,” you say, flashing her your winningest smile.  

“My, you are a charmer.  But don’t think that’s going to do you any good.  You’re still my slave, after all.”  She slides over to you and inspects your body, poking and prodigy you every which way.  And then her back legs twitch, creating taut tethers of webbing that anchor you to the ground.  “So, you say this creature is attracted by lust, do you…”

Nervousness flashes past your eyes as you test the strength of her bindings.  “Well, yeah, but— mmphh!”

She silences you by gluing your lips shut.

“Well, let’s test that theory.  I’ll send you to heaven and see if that draws out the monster - and then I can condemn it to hell.”

Though of course, they probably weren’t kidnapped by sexy spider-ladies and threatened with a lifetime of slavery when they said that.  But still, you think they may have been onto something there.  If you lie and Tula ends up getting lost, she’ll probably take her frustrations out on you.  But if you tell her the truth, maybe there will be an opportunity to give her the slip while she’s contending with navigating towards her absent compatriot.

“It’s not real,” you tell her.  “The wind, none of it.  There’s a monster that makes its home out here, but it uses some kind of psychic powers to fill your mind with illusions and disorient you.  After you get overwhelmed by it you tend to just curl up and fall asleep.  At least, that’s what happened to the lady who was chasing me.”

Tula frowns.  “Then how did you avoid getting caught?”

“You just have to believe in yourself, basically.  Ignore your senses and keep going forward.  Trust in your instincts.  Though I was only trying to *escape* from it, not beat it.  If you’re itching for a fight, I don’t have much more to tell you.”

“Hrmph,” she grunts, before gluing your lips shut once more.  

She has nothing more to say as she scoops you back up and keeps walking.  The wind keeps blowing, but you - and now Tula - know that it’s not really there, and so she pushes forward, heading further and further into the forest.  Eventually, she reaches the area where you first met the psychic bunny.  And her companion is right where you left her… though in a much different state than you remember.

“Zeryl?” Tula walks up to the stone figure and runs a finger along her body to test if it’s another illusion.  “What the hell happened?”

She turns back to you, angrily demanding an explanation.  But all you can do is shrug.  She was sleeping when you last saw her.  Though, looking around, you notice all the Knottie women you had noticed earlier are also scattered about as inert hunks of stone.  You wonder if they’re still conscious in their petrified prisons, still trapped in whatever mental trickery the predator had subjected them too.  There’s no way to know.

“Well… whatever this damn this is, I’m going to kill it!”

The spider-woman seethes with rage, dropping you to the floor then spinning around to glare at every shadow from every nearby tree.

“Are you here?  Well, are you?!  Come out and fight, damn you!”

Her murderous intent is palpable.  The predator must be able to feel it too, wherever it is.  Which probably means it’s not going to show itself if it thinks it’s in danger.  Though hopefully, Tula will be too distracted trying to challenge it that she won’t notice you trying to wriggle away.  You’re just getting started at that when both of you hear something rustling from the bushes nearby.  Tula turns to face it.  You, smartly, decide not to, and continue worming your way to safety.  That is, until you hear something else…]

It’s a sound you’re familiar with, like a cube of ice dropping into a warm glass of water.  A crackling echo, the harbinger of flesh succumbing to the grip of stone.  You’ve ended up transformed into rock countless times during your adventures, so you’ve developed something of an instinct for it.  Which is why you quickly put two and two together, and realize that whatever has done this to her must do it via sight.  She’d heard the rustle, turned towards it, and was instantly petrified for her troubles when she made eye contact.  

You stop moving.  Maybe whatever did it to her won’t consider you a threat if you play dead.  You also wrench your eyes tightly shut, so you only have your ears and your nose to rely on as something starts shuffling towards you on short, stubby legs.  It’s definitely coming towards you, but not with any amount of speed or urgency.  Investigating a threat, but not attacking it.  You remain still, not reacting even when you hear it right beside you, close enough that you can smell its breath.  It reeks of plant matter, which suggests it’s probably an herbivore.  That’s good at least.  The creature spends some time poking and prodding you, but thankfully decides not to do anything more.  As it turns to leave, you risk opening a single eye, and spy the squat form of a large lizard-like creature rumbling away lazily into the forest.  

A basilisk.  Well, good thing you avoided it.  Once you’re sure it’s gone, you wriggle over towards Tula’s frozen statue, and manage to cut yourself free of her webbing using the petrified tips of one of her back legs.  Your hope was that some special property of her spidery limbs allows her to easily manipulate her silk, and it proves to be correct.  Soon you’re free of webbing and able to walk away from the clearing, leaving the statues behind.  If you had to guess, the psychic bunny and the prowling lizard had some kind of symbiotic relationship, working together to handle threats to their territory.  Tula’s murderous intent prompted the bunny to call in for reinforcements, and this was the result.

Definitely good to know.  You resolve to stay away from this place from now on.  Though as you exit the area, you now have to contend with the issue of rescuing your wife.  She’s strung up back at the caverns, and there’s no way in hell you’re leaving without her.  Tula seemed content just leaving her hanging there, which potentially means that no one else from her spider conclave has discovered her yet.  If you move fast, you might be able to get to her before anyone else does.  Alternatively, you might want to first retrace your steps to the orchard where she first caught you, so that you can reclaim the equipment she stripped you of.  If a fight breaks out, you’re going to need your gear to protect yourself.

And the stuff that’s around you now seems especially firm.  Anything outside of a dedicated cutting implement probably isn’t going to be good enough, so it’s better to take it slow and steady to find one than to waste your time hopping around the forest.

And so you get to work.  It’s certainly not easy going.  You’re wrapped up tight, meaning the only method of propulsion you have is to wiggle and hop, making a series of awkward springing leaps to cover the distance needed.  But you keep at it, and after an hour you feel like you’ve covered a decent distance since you started.  Unfortunately, you’re also completely exhausted from the effort.  This proves to be a problem, because it turns out that Tula wasn’t the only spider hunting in this area.

“There you are!” comes a voice from above you.  You look up just in time to see the woman before she tackles you to the ground.  

It’s a familiar face - the second of the spider women who you encountered at the clifftops.  And unlike before, you’re in no position to run away and lure her into another trap.

“I see Tula left us that other cutie all strung up and waiting for fun,” she says, scooping you up and slinging you over a shoulder.  “But I was wondering what happened to this one.  She must be getting old, forgetting to tie you down completely.”

You wiggle and squirm in protest, but it would be a hopeless endeavor at this point, even if you weren’t already tired out.  So you can do nothing but accept your fate as you’re brought back to the caverns.  Revissa is strung up right where Tula left her, and after a moment you join her, slathered in webbing side-by-side with your wife.

It’s really not fair.  You dealt with one spider lady, and then another, but apparently this cave system is positively swarming with them.  Your luck couldn’t hold out forever.  And now, you’re completely out of tricks, and forced to accept you’re well and truly caught.

Considering how many dangerous things you’ve run into while out here, chances are you’d run into one of them while you’re powerless to defend yourself.  Better to take a look around and find some alternative to severing these silken bonds.

And so, you start to hop aimlessly, not quite sure what you’re looking for.  You leave Tula’s slumbering form behind, careful not to wake her, and head in a random direction deeper into the forest.  Navigation is still quite difficult this far in, but before long you manage to stumble back into the spot where you first met the fearsome predator bunny.  Though this time… things have changed.

You see the spider-woman who had been chasing you earlier, one of the two sisters from the cliffs, but now instead of being curled up and asleep, she’s standing, literally, still as stone.  Is this another illusion?  Or is there something else at work here?  Carefully, you shimmy over to the hardened criminal, nudging up against her stone body to see if she reacts.  Predictably, the only response is a dull, stony thump.

Though now, an idea occurs to you.  All these spider ladies have been really adept at manipulating their webbing while wrapping you up, and none of them have ever had any difficulty snipping away tethers or slicing away gags when needed.  Every time they did that, they would use the tip of one of their spindly back legs.  Is there perhaps something special about those limbs?  And… would whatever special feature they have still function while they are stone?  Only one way to find out.

You position yourself up against the petrified edge of her leg and start to move, and, to your satisfaction, you feel the webbing begin to slice away.  Success!  It takes a few minutes, but eventually you manage to completely free yourself.  You’re not entirely sure what did this to her, but a glance around the area reveals more stone statues of the slumbering Knotties you had noticed as well.  Probably best not to stick around, lest you want to join them.

Though as you exit the area, you now have to contend with the issue of rescuing your wife.  She’s strung up back at the caverns, and there’s no way in hell you’re leaving without her.

Tula had been in charge before, but the lady who caught you argues that the fact she lost control over you, to the point that you were hopping around in the forest, means that she’s lost her touch.  You gather that their culture is heavily based on survival of the fittest rules, and now that Tula has been shown to be unfit, no one seems particularly interested in finding out what happened to her.  

You and Revissa get claimed by the new leader, whose name is Zauzyne, you eventually discover, and are dragged back to her personal quarters to be her helpless playthings.  Apparently the old leader had instituted a policy of ‘communal property’, where captured slaves were to be shared among all the residents, but Zauzyne tosses that right out, happy to keep you both on a permanent basis.  And since the silk that binds you is infused with the planet’s Ghost Matter, there’s no need for maintenance on your cocooned bodies, ensuring she can completely ignore the two of you whenever she doesn’t need you to slake her lust.

This new arrangement continues for several weeks.  During that time, Zauzyne seems heavily fixated on showing off her strength, of proving that she deserves to lead.  This eventually culminates in her organizing a full-scale assault on the Knottie camp near the ruins, in an effort to gain more slaves for herself and her followers.  She leaves one night after firing up her troops — and never returns.  You’ll never know exactly what happened, but suffice to say, you can only guess that she wasn’t nearly as good of a leader as she thought she was, and now it is she and her kin who are the slaves.

Not that does you and Revissa any good, because you’re still wrapped up in the depths of a sprawling cave system, trapped in silk that will stay firm and fresh indefinitely.  You have no idea what happened to the rest of your crew - maybe they also were caught by one of the other perils on the planet, or maybe they tried their best to find you but eventually were forced to give up.  Either way, they don’t ever show up for you.  Sadly, that means you’re condemned to solitude, locked away and forgotten, never to see the outside world again.

Now it’s all of them who will be the slaves.

Sadly, the Knotties also released some kind of electro-static net over the orchard the spider-women were cultivating in retaliation for their assault, and the data collection device you’d planted there was destroyed in the process.  Without it, the mission is a failure, and you’re forced to return to your ship and leave the planet empty-handed.

Besides, given your track record so far, you’re pretty sure a direct confrontation with a spider lady is going to end poorly for you whether you’ve got weapons or not.  And so, you double back through the forest with due haste, heading straight for the cliffs.  After some effort you locate the cavern entrance where you were dragged to when Tula first caught you, and to your relief, you find that Revissa is still strung up right where the woman left her.

“Did you miss me?” you say with a smirk.  

But as soon as she notices you her expression changes.  She grunts and groans, squirming around, frantically moving her eyes up towards the ceiling above her.  It’s a warning!  Is there a spider-babe lurking nearby?

That question soon answers itself when you hear a high-pitched squee of delight.

“Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  Oh my gawwwwds, look at this cutie!” a voice says excitedly, before a silk-clad shadow drops down upon you.

It’s rather depressing how quickly the fight ends in your attacker’s favor.  You’re grabbed and snagged, bundled up in silk and tethered to the ceiling side-by-side with your wife before you even manage to get a word off.

“Yay!  I caught something!  Ahhh… and she’s so cute!” says your captor, reaching out to stroke one of your fuzzy ears lovingly.  As she does, she finally steps out of the shadows, allowing you to get a good look at her.  ]

She has bright pink skin and big, beady green eyes, that look bright and eager, and she’s wearing a pretty silken dress that’s open in the back to show off the fuzzy fur covering her back legs.  Unlike the other arachnids you’ve met up until now, this one is more cute than gorgeous, and seems decidedly less threatening.  Though that didn’t stop her from defeating you instantly.

“My name is Merry!” she says giddily.  “And we’re going to be the bestest of friends!  I promise I’ll play with you every single day, and give you lots of snuggles at night, too!”

Well… at least she’s friendly.  She spends the next few hours giving you tons of hugs and kisses before another of her kind shows up.

“Ugh, I looked all over, but I couldn’t find the escapee,” says a voice from near the entrance.  “Though I did pick up her stuff.  Maybe it will lead us to her.”

The woman that enters is familiar to you - the second of the two sisters who attacked you back near the cliffs.  She doesn’t notice you at first, probably because she’s got her nose buried in your communicator device.

“Hi Zauzyne!” Merry says, nuzzling her cheek against your own.  “Are you maybe talking about this cutie?”

Zauzyne looks up and groans.  “Oh come on!  She was supposed to be mine!”

Merry pouts.  “Well, I caught her fair and square, so now we’re gonna be friends.  Besides, Tula caught her before you did, so if she was gonna go to anyone, it should have been her.”

“Yeah, well, Tula’s not answering her calls anymore, so I’m gonna guess something in the forest got her.  Which means I’m in charge now, and I say that wolf belongs to me!”

Merry hugs you protectively, but Zauzyne seems quite adamant that you should belong to her.

During intercourse, you’re treated more or less like an object.  Yes, a spider-babe will see to it that you get pleasured, but that’s mostly just because they love the taste of your fluids, and they love the sound of the moans you make as you mewl helplessly into your gag.

All this is to say that the next fifteen minutes are quite satisfying.  However, the love-making session does not exactly end as expected.  Because right as things are reaching their maximum level of hot and steamy, Tula’s body starts to sag.   She’s right in the middle of grinding her hips against your knee, using you as nothing more than a tool for stimulation when her eyes droop.  For a moment, she has a look of confusion on her face, but that slowly gives way to a sort of blank contentment.  And then she backs away, curls up on the ground, and falls asleep.

You’d be perplexed by this turn of events, but you’d seen it once before.  This is exactly what happened to the previous spider woman who captured you, when she became overwhelmed by the psychic pulsations from the mysterious predator that lures people into its clutches here in the deepest part of the woods.  And now it seems like it has claimed another victim.  It’s incredibly lucky that you knew enough about it to avoid suffering the same fate.  Although…

“Grrmmmphh!  Mmmmfggghh!  Mm-mmmphh!”  

There’s another problem.  Namely, that you are bound, gagged, and anchored to the forest floor with webbing, rendering you utterly incapable of any sort of movement.  Try as you might, your body refuses to budge.  This… is not ideal.  You can’t even stand up, nor can you roll along the ground, meaning that for all intents and purposes, you’re just as helpless as Tula is.  And at least *she* seems to be getting treated to some pleasant dreams while she’s trapped.

Unfortunately, there’s not really a solution to this puzzle.  All you can do is sit here and wiggle impotently, waiting for something to come along to change the dynamic of the situation.

It might even be multiple days, with nothing to help you spend the time other than the sound of Tula’s steady breathing coming from her slumbering form nearby.  But eventually, something does change.

The best way you can describe it is like a dizziness spell.  Suddenly you feel disoriented and distracted, your vision going blurry and your ears ringing with white noise.  This, you figure, must be the work of that predator bunny again.  But what purpose could it serve?

Distracted as you are, you can still sense the motion as Tula’s body slowly pulls itself to its feet.  Her spindly legs spread wide, and a look of elation creeps across her face.  It’s the expression of a woman who’s just spotted the perfect prey, and now she’s planning out on how best to snatch it up.  Is that what she’s seeing in her mind?

For a while she just stands there, lost in her pleasant thoughts, barely moving.  Or wait… no… at some point, it seems like she’s stopped moving entirely!

You shake your head and try to focus.  That psychic assault is really messing with your perception, because when you squint, it almost looks like Tula’s body has been died a uniform gray color.  But that of course is impossible, since that would suggest that she had… been…

No matter how you parse it, that really does seem to be the case.  But how?  What could have done this to her?

The culprit, as it turns out, was a basilisk.  A fearsome lizard-like creature with the power to turn anyone who meets its gaze to stone.  Oftentimes they do so to feed off of the life energy of their victims, filling their territory with the petrified bodies of prey.  Lucky for you, this one isn’t interested in that.

Not that you have any awareness of this fact - or of anything else, for that matter.  Because now you’re just a stone statue, unseeing, unfeeling, and unthinking.  Little more than a hunk of stone, at least until someone comes along to restore you.  But if you *were* aware, you might have put two and two together, and decided that the bunny and the lizard were partners, somehow.  Perhaps in some kind of symbiotic relationship.  The psychic bunny incapacitates intruders, but their slumbering minds still create mental feedback in the area which makes it hard for it to sleep.  Thankfully, the basilisk is at hand to quiet those minds indefinitely, letting the two of them live safely here in the heart of the woods without any threats of danger.  It is, altogether, a rather cushy setup.

For them, not for you.

You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew - not the least of which is because you are incapable of knowing anything at all in this stony state.

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="482" name="FE05EB" tags="" position="2675,2950" size="100,100">The two butt heads for hours, but eventually, things get settled the only way spider-babes know how.  Zauzyne challenges Merry to trial by combat, and summarily defeats her.  Thus the pink-skinned cutie gets wrapped up and put on display in the caves for all the other women in the colony to have their fun with.

Somehow, you feel bad for her.  Unlike the others, she seemed like a kind and loving person.  Maybe with time it would have been possible to convince her to respect the free will of other people instead of snatching them up and turning them into pets.  Though now she’s just a slave herself.  After a week of public display, Zauzyne brings her to her quarters to keep as a personal trophy, strung up in silk right beside you and Revissa.  The three of you are helpless to do anything about it, reduced to squirming playthings to be used at her leisure.  

And it seems she has no intention of changing that.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="483" name="FE05F" tags="" position="2825,2700" size="100,100">“Mmphh!  Hrggggmmhhpphh!” you say firmly.

The two arguing spiders ignore your grunts.  At least, until a voice rings out from your pile of equipment that Zauzyne recovered.

“Ladies,” chirps a neutral electronic voice.  “Please, there’s no need to fight.  There’s enough of me to go around.”

It’s coming from the gag-talk translator you’d picked up in the Knottie outpost.  Previously you’d used it to communicate with Ros’eela, but it’s just as useful for making yourself understandable to the spider-babes.

The pair blink in confusion for a moment, looking between you and then the device.  Merry picks up on it first.

“Oh wow!  What an amazing invention.  With this we can talk with our friends even when they’re all bundled up!”

Zauzyne scowls.  “Are you insane?  Why would we ever care what a slave has to say?!”

She motions to smash the device, but Merry plucks it away with a line of silk before she gets the chance.

“She’s not a slave, she’s my new best friend!” Merry protests vigorously.  

Zauzyne growls.  “That kind of talk is a sign of weakness.  Maybe that would fly when Tula was in charge, but now that she’s missing, it seems like I’m the one calling the shots.”

You see an opportunity, so you take it.  “Oh, she’s not missing,” you say through the translator.  “I know exactly where she is.  Though she *is* in a bit of trouble…”

You spend some time summarizing the location where you last saw her, and briefly outline the peril she faced… though you leave out a number of key details.  The sort of details that would help them avoid suffering the same fate,

Merry gasps.  “Oh no!  We should go save her!”

“If she got herself into trouble, she can go ahead and get herself out of it,” Zauzyne says dismissively. 

You’re starting to pick up on the sort of philosophy these spider-women live by - very survival of the fittest.  The weak are considered unfit to lead, that kind of thing.  Though that does give you an idea.

“Yeah, but if you save her from trouble, won’t that make you seem even stronger than if you just ignored it?” you suggest.  “Imagine it - the humiliation she would feel when she’s forced to be rescued.  Maybe she’ll even openly submit to you as the new leader!”

Zauzyne’s eyes light up.  “Oh-ho… not a bad idea, slave.  Though I still never gave you permission to talk.”

She snatches the translator back from Merry’s hands and crushes it against the wall. 
(set: $gagtalk to false)
“But she has a point… I believe a rescue mission is in order.”

Merry hops up and down excitedly.  “Oh, it’s like a field trip!  And maybe we’ll make some new friends along the way!”

The other spider-lady just rolls her eyes before skittering out onto the cliffs.  Merry hangs back a moment to give you one last hug, then follows after her.

You breathe a sigh of relief once they’re gone.  That’s another crisis averted.  Though it doesn’t answer how the heck you’re going to get out of here.  After all, you’re still wrapped up and completely helpless.  However, once they’re gone, you hear an encouraging grunt from Revissa.  Once she gets your attention, she nods towards your feet – and you can’t believe your luck!

“Mmphh!” you exclaim in excitement.

It looks like while they were scuffling over the translator, Zauzyne accidentally dropped the runic knife from your pack.  And against all odds, it has somehow gotten tangled up in the webbing right near your hands!  So if you could just wiggle in exactly the right way, maybe… yes!  You’ve got it!

Grabbing hold of the knife is only the start of the battle, but it’s the opening you needed.  And after a good thirty minutes of grunting, groaning, wiggling, and stretching, you finally manage to slice yourself free.  Revissa gets cut down next, and a few minutes later you’ve gotten yourselves dressed back up again and fully equipped.

“That might be the first time in history my luck actually turned out in our favor,” you quip, as the two of you head towards the exit.

You’re careful to retrace your steps from earlier, sticking to familiar locations and not running off on any more side quests that’ll just get you caught by something else.  

“What do you think will become of those spider ladies?” Revissa wonders aloud as you walk.

“Honestly… I’m not sure,” you admit.  “I almost feel bad for them.  Especially Merry.  She seems like she’d have been a nice girl if she’d been brought up in a culture that wasn’t all about kidnapping and slavery.”

You both go quiet for a moment.  But eventually, you have to admit that there’s not much more you can do for them.  There’s been so many near misses already, risking yourselves for their sake just isn’t a reasonable thing to do.  And so you make it back to the start of the forest, and reach the end of this leg of the mission.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="485" name="FE05G" tags="" position="2975,2700" size="100,100">You start walking back through the cliffs, but eventually, you stop and shake your head in annoyance.

“Gah!” you yell out.  “I just can’t leave like this.”

Revissa looks at you in confusion.  “What’s wrong?”

“Those sexy spiders,” you moan.  “Sure, they wanted to kidnap us and keep us as slaves forever… but it doesn’t feel right abandoning them like this.  Especially Merry.  She seems like she’d have been a nice girl if she’d been brought up in a different environment.”

“There’s no guarantee that Merry and Zauzyne got caught up in the predator’s lair too,” Revisssa insists.  “We could just be wasting our time.”

You shake your head.  “Maybe if I’d given them more information.  But as it stands… yeah, I think they’re screwed.  As much as I hate to say it… we should go back and help them.”

There’s a long silence before Revissa breaths out in exhaustion.  “You know, I would hate you, if I didn’t love you so much.  That heroic streak of yours is going to be the death of us some day.”

“I wouldn’t call myself a hero or anything…” you say lamely.  “I just… it just doesn’t sit right with me if I don’t do the right thing sometimes.”

Revissa kicks you hard on the shin.  “That’s called being a hero, you dunce.”

But then you both laugh, and it seems like it’s agreed upon.  As crazy as it is, you’re going to go on a rescue mission for the spiders.

You lied to her about how the predator operates, telling her it preyed on fears, tricking her into focussing on what made her the most scared.  That proved to be nothing more serious than an allergy to coconut, though it was enough to get her to lose her composure, and eventually fall asleep, just like the spider whom you’d deceived earlier.  However, when you found that other spider, she’d been turned to stone, though that proved to be useful in helping you cut yourself free.](else: )[

After telling her the truth about how the predator operates, you made it to the spot where her fellow spider had been incapacitated, only to find that she had been turned to stone in the meantime.  The culprit was a basilisk which seemed to be working together with the psychic bunny - and it soon visited the same fate upon Tula.]

“And I suppose you’re worried Merry will get turned to stone too?” Revissa asks.

“I mean… she seems nice,” you say.

Revissa raises an eyebrow.  “Just nice?  And not, perhaps, potential girlfriend material?”

You cough.  “I mean… she seems like she’d be fun to have around… and I bet she gives just the warmest and, erm, *tightest* cuddles.”

“You’re hopeless,” she says, rolling her eyes.

Though the two of you have been married for a while now, the relationship is open enough that you’re both allowed to take on additional girlfriends if the mood arises - so long as the partner approves of them.  So, yeah, maybe you’re hoping Merry will be so overjoyed that you saved her that she’ll agree to join the crew for a bit.  Surely if you explain it to her carefully she’ll understand that other people should only be kidnapped and treated like pets if they consent to it first.  The fact that you *will* consent to it (so long as it’s not a permanent arrangement) will hopefully help get the point across.

That, of course, is wishful thinking, and you’ll still need to save her first anyway.  Assuming she even *needs* saving.  You’re about to find out either way, as you now approach the furthest reaches of the deep forest.

(set: $picF133 to true)

Where once there were two stone spiders, now there are four.  Merry and Zauzyne have succumbed to the same peril as the others, transfixed in stone with their clothing having flaked away from their bodies.  Zauzyne has the pose of someone who had just spotted her enemy, pointing in the direction of a sound she might have heard, such as a rustling of leaves - and now she’s frozen that way, her finger directed towards a threat that has long since departed.  Merry saw the threat too, and, it would seem, thought that it was quite cute.   Her starry-eyed expression is now indefinitely preserved on her face, no longer able to see the object of her adoration.

Revissa spends some time looking the quartet over, sensing their auras with her magic, and gives you a summary of their condition.

“It’s a fairly basic petrification,” she says.  “It won’t wear off on its own, but it’s also easy enough to restore with traditional healing magics.  I don’t quite have the energy for it right now, but those diamonds Lumina gave us before should do the trick.  Only…”

You raise an eyebrow.  “What’s the issue?”

“Well, we don’t have an infinite supply of them, and this is a lot of stone spiders.  If we cured them, we probably wouldn’t have any left for ourselves if we needed them later.”

That’s definitely something to consider.  Though… it also gives you an idea.  Maybe you don’t need to cure them at all.  Maybe you could just… hold on to them for a while.   Consider them a trophy of your accomplishments thus far.  You’d definitely turn them back… eventually.  Or at least you’d turn Merry back.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="488" name="FE05H" tags="" position="3225,2700" size="100,100">At this point, you’re used to the predator’s tricks.  You and Revissa push deeper into the forest, and all around you the air begins to feel thick and heavy, as if with smoke.  The crackling of roaring flames resounds from every corner, the warmth of a blazing forest fire washing over you like a curtain of heat.  But you know it’s all an illusion and you push past it, eventually emerging at your destination.

What you find is… more or less what you expected.  Where you left one spider, slumbering peacefully in illusory dreams, now you find three.  It seems that Merry and Zauzyne fared no better than their predecessors, and have fully succumbed to the influence of the psychic bunny.  Not that the creature has shown itself in some time.  

Further in, you find the fourth arachnid woman as well, the one who had been turned to stone and helpfully assisted in removing Tula’s silk.  Though they are in short supply, you decide to be generous and pull out one of the restoration diamonds that Lumina gave you at the start of the adventure, applying it to her petrified form.  Divine energy flows from the gemstone into her body and restores her to flesh, making her slump unconscious to the ground.  Its magic spent, the diamond then cracks and crumbles as well.

You pick up the fourth woman and drag her to the others, lining them up in one big, happy, terribly dangerous pile of gorgeous beauties.

“So how do we actually want to do this?” Revissa asks.  “It seems like the predator can keep them asleep indefinitely.  Do we try waking them up?”

“Hrmm…” you murmur.  “Probably not the best idea.  Even though we’re saving them, they’ll probably wrap us up the minute they’re conscious.”

“Well, the one who was petrified should wake up normally,” Revissa suggests.  “So we could just leave her some instructions on how to navigate out of here and let her figure it out.”

“That does seem the safest option,” you say.  “Although… there is something else we could try…”

Revissa gets that annoyed look in her eyes that happens every time you suggest something stupid.  Is the idea even worth bringing up?

[[Go with Revissa’s idea-&gt;FE05HA]]
[[Make your suggestion-&gt;FE05HB]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="489" name="FE05GC" tags="" position="2975,3075" size="100,100">You sigh, but then begin pulling out the healing items from your bag.

“I suppose it’s the right thing to do,” you say, though you’re not super happy about it.  Those diamonds don’t come cheap, and they’d be a great thing to have on hand if you were to get petrified some time in the future… which has a high likelihood of happening, given your track record.  

But you hold firm to your principles and get to work.  One by one, you take out a diamond and apply its magic to a petrified arachnid, expending the divine energy contained within the gemstone and shattering it to dust.  They work like a charm, and soon enough each lovely spider is restored to her usual, fleshy self.  Luckily, they remain slumped and unconscious after being healed, but you know they could wake up any minute.  And so, as much as it pains you to do it, you write a short note explaining how to escape the forest and leave it beside them, and then slink back towards the entrance.

“You look glum for someone who just did something heroic,” Revissa notes after a while.

“I know,” you say sadly.  “I would have loved to have stuck around and get to know them better.  Especially Merry.  But if I did–”

“Then you’d spend the rest of your life as their slave,” Revissa notes evenly.

“I mean… would that be the *worst* thing in the world?” you muse absently to yourself.

Revissa pats you on the shoulder affectionately.  “When the mission is over, I promise I’ll wrap you up nice and tight and keep you that way for a whole day,” she offers.  “And give you all the lusty cuddles you want.”

That definitely perks you up.  And so you have a bounce in your step as the two of you make it back to the edge of the forest, your mission here complete.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="490" name="FE05GD" tags="" position="3100,2700" size="100,100">“Okay, hear me out here…” you say carefully.

Revissa sighs.  “That phrase has never preceded something I actually want to hear said,” she grumbles.

“Fair.  But listen to me anyway.  We’ve got four stone spiders, and if we heal them right now, we’ll be out of restoration items, right?  So… why don’t we just not heal them *now*?”

“You want us to trek all the way back here later?!” Revissa yells.

“No… not that either.  What if we just… held on to them for a while.  I’ll use my comm device as a beacon and call the ship over, and they can just pick up the statues with the tractor beam and load them into the cargo bay.  And then we’d have them safe and secure in our care, ready to be brought back to life when it’s convenient.”

Revissa raises an eyebrow.  “You’re starting to sound awfully a lot like some of those statue-collecting villains we’ve dealt with in the past.”

“What?  No, of course not!  I mean, we’d turn them back… eventually.  We’d only have a gallery of sexy stone spiders for… a little while.”

Your wife rolls her eyes, but does eventually agree to the plan.  And so you set it in motion and write a quick message to your crew back on the ship together with the location data from your communicator.  From here, it should be as easy as standing around and waiting.

Which… in a moment, is going to prove very easy to do indeed.  Because you and Revissa hear the sudden noise of a loud explosion from right behind you just as you hit send, and years of instinct kick in before your conscious mind has a chance to object.  Which means you turn around to face the sound, each of you raising your arms defensively, expecting a concussive blast or something to wash over you

Instead… you’re just met with a pair of beady, reptilian eyes…

If you’d been thinking clearly, you might have been able to predict it.  You had all the information to work with, after all.  A psychic predator that can create false images and noises.  And a prowling basilisk whose gaze renders any who meet its eyes into solid stone.  Working together, it would be easy for these two creatures to trick someone for just a moment, get them to turn their attention to right where they needed to be.  If it had been longer than a moment, perhaps one of you would have seen through the ruse.  

But you didn’t, and now you’re both stone.  Unmoving, unthinking, unfeeling.  Two more solid rock sculptures to dot this remote forest sanctuary.  Though at least your friends know where you are.  That means they’ll come to save you, right?

“I don’t understand why we *all* needed to come out here,” she grumbles.

Vhaja frowns, glancing down at the topological map on her communicator. 

“Because Melfy has not answered since the last message she sent, which probably means something has happened to her.  And since we detected high levels of psionic activity in the area, it only makes sense for you and I to be present.  We are much better equipped to handle tricks and illusions than the others.”

Krysta leaps nimbly from one tree branch to another, her squirrel tail flapping wildly in the wind.

“And I’m here because I’m actually at home in places like this,” she says with a grin.  “Because, case in point, I think I’ve spotted something, dead ahead.  It looks like a bunch of motionless bodies, standing upright.”

Lumina grips her staff nervously, her wings fluttering lightly in the breeze.

“Do you think they’ve been transformed in some way?  I’d better prepare a healing spell…”

And so the four emerge into the deepest part of the woods, and are shocked at what they find.  A smattering of stone Knotties spread randomly throughout the area.  A quartet of stone spiders, all lined up in a row.  And…

“There they are!” Krysta yells, though she’s clever enough not to just run towards the granite bodies of her compatriots.

For your part, you and Revissa remain exactly where you were the moment that you were transformed.  Still as stone, frozen and unmoving, clothing flaked away to reveal your naked bodies to the eyes of your companions.  If you were able to think, you would probably be relieved to know that they were here.  Though it’s probably better that you’re not, given what happens next.

“Ooooohhh… look at all those tasty-looking acorns,” Krysrta suddenly says, reaching out towards a barrel of treats that isn’t really there.

She’s the only one who fully falls for the ruse.

“No, Krysta, it’s something else,” Lumina warns, holding out a cautioning hand.

“We must be under attack!” Vhaja exclaims, holding out her hands to conjure the magical energy for a runic bow and arrow to defend herself with.

Jyumon takes a step back.  “Wait, no, check the magical spectrum, Vhaja.  It’s—”

But she doesn’t get a chance to finish that thought.  The psychic predator drops the illusion it was forming and reveals its partner for the four new interlopers to see.

And they *do* see it.  Quite well.  Though only for a moment.

A crackling sound reverberates through the forest, as four more victims join the macabre gallery lost here among the trees.  As before, clothing crumbles away, half-prepared spells fizzle out into nothing, and the only hope anyone here had of getting out of this mess fades away into nothing.

“...”

Krysta says nothing, her imagined trove of acorns as out of reach as her chance of escape.

“...”

The defensive ward Lumina was working on never completes, though it wouldn’t have done much good.  It was something to protect against mental intrusions, not stony transformations.

“...”

Vhaja never gets the chance to unleash an arrow of arcane force at her target.  Her sharp Elvaan eyes are usually perfect at locking on to her targets, though that proved to be her downfall here.

“...”

Jyumon didn’t want to come here in the first place, but now she won’t be leaving for a very, very long time.  Though at least the tail she was using to swat away insects is effective at propping up her unbalanced body, so she won’t have to suffer the indignity of toppling over.  Not that she’d be aware of it if she did.

And so, you and Revissa rejoin your faithful crew… though perhaps not in the way you had hoped.

There’s nothing you can do about it.  There’s nothing *any* of you can do about it.  You’re just statues, and that’s all you’ll ever be.  Over the years, moss will grow in the little nooks and crevasses of your stone body, and tiny hairline cracks will spread over your figure, though none will ever be enough to cause your frozen form any real damage.  Cobwebs will collect all around you, connecting your tail to your legs, or your extended hand to the surprised look etched upon your face.

No one ever finds you.  Why would they?  You came here in secret, and everyone who knew it is right here with you, petrified at your side.  This is your home now.  And though you’ll never know it, the forest will make good use of that.  Birds will nest in your hair.  Hungry critters will forage for grubs in the dirt beneath your feet.  Creeping vines, searching for sunlight, will curl up your legs, trying to get higher.  You and your friends are a part of the forest now, as if you always belonged here.  And, as the years turn to centuries, stretching on until forever, the amount of time you spent as a person will be far eclipsed by your life as a statue, meaning that maybe you always *did* belong here.

But lucky for you, you swallowed that Star Scout homing beacon at the start of your adventure.  And so, though it takes a long, long time, salvation does eventually come for you.  Though maybe not as quickly as you might have liked.

When a Star Scout passing through the sector happens to pick up on an ancient distress beacon, she decides to investigate, landing on the planet and arriving at your little grove.  There, she finds the many statues that have accumulated, petrified sculptures that have suffered minor wear and tear over the years.  In that time, tiny networks of cracks have formed along your stone body - not enough to do any harm, just enough to add some character.  Moss has spread between the nooks and crevasses of your stone figure, and creeping vines have curled up your legs, searching for sunlight.  You look as if you’d always belonged here, and, to be fair, given the amount of time you’ve stood in the very spot, it’s not entirely inaccurate.  After all, it’s been several hundred years, far eclipsing the amount of time you’d been active and mobile in the world.

Eventually the Scout does get you and your friends restored.  Though when you awaken, you find yourself in a galaxy far different than the one you left.  Ahead of you lie many new and exciting adventures in what to you is the distant future, but that’s a story for another day.  Regardless, you’ve decidedly failed at the mission you originally came here for, all those years ago.

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="494" name="FE05HA" tags="" position="3225,2825" size="100,100">Revissa’s withering glare saps any enthusiasm you might have had for your hare-brained idea.

“On second thought… your plan sounds much safer,” you concede.

“I thought so.”

And so, much to your regret, you just type out some instructions and send it wirelessly to one of the spider ladies’ comm devices, then turn around and head back out through the forest.  By now it’s easy going, the illusions barely tripping you up.  Before long you’re out of the danger zone, though you can’t help but dwell on the thought of what might have been, had you been a bit more daring (and a lot more stupid).

“You look glum for someone who just did something heroic,” Revissa notes after a while.

“I know,” you say sadly.  “It’s just that I would have loved to have gotten to know them better.  Especially Merry.  But if I did–”

“Then you’d spend the rest of your life as their slave,” Revissa notes evenly.

“I mean… would that be the *worst* thing in the world?” you muse absently to yourself.

Revissa pats you on the shoulder affectionately.  “When the mission is over, I promise I’ll wrap you up nice and tight and keep you that way for a whole day,” she offers.  “And give you all the lusty cuddles you want.”

That definitely perks you up.  And so you have a bounce in your step as the two of you make it back to the edge of the forest, your mission here complete.

[[Exit the forest-&gt;FE07]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="495" name="FE05HB" tags="" position="3225,2950" size="100,100">“Okay, so, hear me out here,” you begin.

Revissa groans.  “No intelligent plan ever begins with those words.”

“True.  But no plan I’ve ever made has been intelligent, and I’ve still managed to get us out of every scrape we’ve found ourselves in.”


“Except for the times it failed miserably.”

“Yeah, except for those times.  Anyway!  My idea here is… we’ve got a ship in orbit, four gorgeous spider-ladies at our mercy, and one powerful, beautiful, highly competent, and extremely accommodating nature druid who could conjure up some thick, sturdy vines at will.”

Revissa face-palms.  “You want to… tie up the spider women and keep them on our ship?”

“...yes?” you say tentatively.

“And you don’t think that’s a terrible idea?”

“I mean… I do.  But also… imagine it, what we could do with so many sexy prisoners!”

“And what happens when they inevitably break free, escape, then turn the tables on us?”

You grin.  “Well, that just sounds like a sexy vacation to me!”

“No, it sounds like a terribly stupid idea!” Revissa says, raising her voice sharply.

Both of you immediately realize that it was a really bad idea to make that much noise.  You hear the one spider-lady not trapped in her dreams start to stir, yawning lazily.  Which would have been bad enough, but it seems that your ill-timed yelling match was a poor decision for a totally different reason.  Something lurking nearby has decided it’s had enough of you two, and makes its move to remove the annoyance you present once and for all.

It starts with the sound of a loud explosion coming from right behind you.  Despite the fact that you both know better, your distraction from the argument and years of experience reacting quickly to danger prompts the two of you to turn around to face the sound, each of you raising your arms defensively, expecting a concussive blast or something to wash over you

Instead… you’re just met with a pair of beady, reptilian eyes…

If you’d been thinking clearly, you might have been able to predict it.  You had all the information to work with, after all.  A psychic predator that can create false images and noises.  And a prowling basilisk whose gaze renders any who meet its eyes into solid stone.  Working together, it would be easy for these two creatures to trick someone for just a moment, get them to turn their attention to right where they needed to be.  If it had been longer than a moment, perhaps one of you would have seen through the ruse.  

But you didn’t, and now you’re both stone.  Unmoving, unthinking, unfeeling.  Nothing but a pair of solid rock sculptures, decorating a hidden forest sanctuary.  Though you won’t be there for long.

And she discovers that all it takes to rouse her companions is a sharp poke on the posterior with the point of one of her back legs.  Together, they puzzle out the way to escape the forest, and take with them a couple of heavy, but highly collectible souvenirs.  Before long the two statues are installed back in their cave system.  It’s not quite a silk-spun sex slave, but it’s still the generally correct shape, and so the colony makes good use of your stone bodies for some stimulation when the desire calls for it, grinding themselves to completion against your inert granite forms.

Over the years, they’ll collect more traditional slaves, of course, and string them up in their caverns to be used for entertainment.  But something of a trend catches on thanks to you and Revissa, and, over time, some spider gals even start to enjoy the idea of petrified partners during intercourse.  They take some supplements to modify the composition of their naturally produced venom to allow it to calcify their captives, and begin a campaign to spread the word.  Before long, the colony is split right down the middle between whether slaves should be soft and squirming or stiff and solid.

You and Revissa, of course, are unaware of any of this, because you’re just a pair of petrified playthings.  It would actually be trivially easy to restore you to flesh - the basilisk’s gaze isn’t nearly as powerful as that of a gorgon, for instance - but no one has any inclination to do that.  And so, you remain where you are, a tantalizing fixture made of sculpted stone for the rest of your days.  You’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew - not the least of which is because you’re incapable of knowing anything at all.  Maybe they were caught by some other peril on the planet, or maybe they were forced to leave when they were unable to find what happened to you.  

Whatever the case, this is your life now.  Though you’re sadly not conscious enough to enjoy it.

Had you stayed longer than a few weeks, it might have even become a trend.  But thankfully, the Star Scout homing beacon you swallowed at the start of your adventure allows the rest of your crew to track you down.  And though there’s too many spiders for them to simply rush in and rescue you, they do manage to negotiate an exchange.  They trade all the data they’d gathered on the planet from the mission for your freedom, and get the two of you delivered to the ship in large shipping crates full of packing peanuts.

That’s where you find yourself when you next wake up thanks to Lumina’s healing magic.  Though you almost wish you hadn&#39;t woken up at all, given how angry Revissa is at you for causing you to fail the mission after making such a stupid suggestion.  You’d like to say you’ve learned your lesson after this, but let’s be honest, you’re going to do this again and again, plenty of times over.  And so, though you may have ruined the plan and let everyone down, at least you’re still conscious and mobile enough to make sure that you’ll have the chance to disappoint them all again, some time in the future.

Years go by without any changes.  With your crew captured and strung up beside you, there’s no one left who even knows where you are.  Rescue seems like a distant possibility, forcing you all to acclimate yourselves to the life of a slave.  It’s not until much later, decades after your capture, that luck finally happens to strike.  A passing Star Scout randomly manages to pick up on the homing beacon sent out by the candy you swallowed at the start of your adventure and comes down to the planet to investigate.  With the force of a galactic law enforcement agent behind her words, she manages to eventually negotiate for your release… with a condition.  Namely, that the spiders get to hold on to you for the next hundred years.

It’s the best she can do, so she signs the deal and moves on, leaving you and your friends to suffer helplessly until that point.

Almost a year passes before anything changes.  For most of your captivity, you were left wondering what happened to the rest of your crew.

Your fate and hers was intertwined, so once your situation was no longer hopeless she, too, was able to escape.  From now on, you’ll certainly be looking over your shoulder, wondering if she’s ever going to show up again to mess with you.

Obviously it goes without saying, but by this point your mission was a complete failure.  It’s touching to know how hard your friends fought to save you, but also depressing to realize it was your fault they had to fight so hard in the first place.

Revissa shrugs.  “Let her have her fun, I suppose.  She’s earned it.  In fact…”

She holds out her staff, calling on the spirits of nature to assist her in conjuring a powerful leafy vine to curl up around the support pillar you’re glued to.  It twists over your body, winding and squeezing up against your crotch area to provide you a bit more stimulation.  A load moan from your lips indicates you appreciate the effort as you further indulge yourself.

“And what about the lady outside?” Ros’eela says.  “It doesn’t look like she’s going to be able to escape on her own.”

They both glance out the doorway, where Petal is still nicely wrapped up in Tula’s silk.

(if: $petalfriend is true)[“We’ll cut her free, of course,” Revissa says.  “She’s not a bad person, she’s just operating under a very different set of beliefs than us.  But we did manage to reach an understanding.  And I’m sure she’d have rescued us if the positions were reversed.”

And so, while you wiggle in enjoyment, they get down to business, slicing away her webbing and letting her go.  In a way, you’re sad you were left behind, because they spend an hour being ‘thanked’ by her, and you get left out.  When they finish, they wish her goodbye and send her on her way, exchanging promises to keep the forest free of any more interlopers.  When they finally return to the room, they find you strung up right where they left you, though perhaps the silk around your crotch is a bit more damp than before.](else: )[Revissa thinks for a long time.  “Erm… I never say things like this, but… I guess I’d like to… keep her?”

Ros’eela raises an eyebrow.  “I didn’t peg you for the sort who was into keeping slaves.”

“No, it’s not like that!” your wife insists.  “It’s just… we only barely escaped from her before.  But even so, I never really got the impression she was evil.  Just… operating under a very different set of beliefs than us.  I’d love to take the time to really get to know her.  I feel like we’d have a lot in common.  But obviously I can’t spend that time now, since we’re in the middle of a mission.”

“She’s clearly part plant, though,” Ros’eela points out.  “Keeping her locked up on a spaceship might not be good for her health.”

“Well, the Lucky Break used to have a Florian crew member for a while,” Revissa says.  “They are also part plant, and the infrastructure set up when she lived there is still in place.  Or, more accurately, Melfy was too lazy to ever have it removed.  So… I’m sure we could find some way to keep hold of her.”

Ros’eela doesn’t object, and you *can’t* object, given the state you are in.  All you can do is keep on wiggling while they busy themselves packaging up the plant lady for transport back to the landing sight, making use of the hover-drones available on site.  It takes them an hour to get everything finished, but eventually they finish and return to the room, finding you strung up right where they left you – though perhaps the silk around your crotch is a bit more damp that before.(set: $petalwebcollect to true)]

(if: $faecaught is true)[With that taken care of, Revissa takes a moment to look around the room.  “Of course… there’s one other thing we need to deal with.”

Everyone looks towards the curvaceous fae women, still bundled up in silk and suspended from the ceiling.  She’s been quietly squirming the whole time, but it seems they’re ready to figure out what to do with her.

[[See her get taken care of-&gt;FE04EE]]](else: )[“Well, it looks like we’re ready to go,” Revissa says, looking up at you with a grin.  “Ready to be untied?”

“So I’ve been meaning to ask…” says Ros’eela.  “Why is there someone that looks just like the trickster spirit Boun’Dara strung up in webs and wiggling around in our storage room?”

Revissa shakes her head.  “That is not her true appearance; she seems to take the form of whatever fae entity has most prominence in your mind.  To me, she looks like the great Guardian Moth, Un-Rama, and to my wife to a half-fae princess she once met in her travels.”

Right, you still haven’t fully wrapped your mind around the fact that the curvy captive squirming in silk ahead of you doesn’t look the same to everyone else.

“Hrmm… interesting.  I’ve never tried tying up a fae before,” Ros’eela muses.  “I bet it would be difficult…”

“Yes… she only wound up like this because Melfy won a coin toss against her, and set a rule that the two of them are equally helpless when enmeshed in silk.”

“Does that mean that if we untie Melfy, *she’ll* go free as well?”

Revissa considers that for a moment.  “That’s a good point.  Yes, it seems likely.”

The fae woman makes a playful grunt into her gag.

“So I guess you’ll just have to leave your wife webbed up forever, yeah?” Ros’eela says playfully.

You try hard not to look *too* excited about that prospect.  Though the conversation seems to give Ros’eela an idea.  She excuses herself for a moment, rushing to one of the other buildings, leaving you and the fae still hopelessly tethered to the ceiling.  When she comes back, she’s dragging a very fancy looking case behind her.

“What’s in the box?” Revissa asks.

Ros’eela grins and snaps open the lid, bathing the room in an eerie blue glow.

“Something I’m not supposed to know about.  It’s a set of enchanted iron sealing shackles, complete with essence modulator gemstone arrays,” she says, with the same sort of enthusiasm as a sportsball card collector showing off an ultra-rare first edition star player rookie card.  “I only knew about it because I saw it mentioned on the shipping manifest while doing data entry.  It belonged to the outpost’s forewoman, but she’s… err… a bit gunked up at the moment.”

You recall that the outpost is chock-full of amber-encased Knotties, thanks to Petal’s intervention.

“But yeah, these beauties are rated Triple-S on the standard bondage secureness scale, and are certified to work on most extra-planar and incorporeal entities, up to and including arch-fey.”

Revissa raises an eyebrow.  “You think they can contain her?”

Ros’eela nods.  “Yeah… they’ll hold her,” she says. “Here, let me show you.”

And so she eagerly gets to work.  With each piece of the bondage gear she snaps onto the captive fae, she excitedly runs down its functions.  The ball-gag comes equipped with psionic dampeners that cancel out telepathy and scramble the semantic meaning of helpless grunts, ensuring even gag-talk translators won’t be able to decipher her words.  And the crotch attachment has a ‘perpetual stimulation synchronizer’, she explains, that will create an ‘indefinite feedback loop of unending pleasure’.  It seems to do the trick, since once she snaps it on, the fae woman’s eyes roll back in delight, her body quivering in time with the device’s vibrations.  Soon enough, all the webbing has been replaced with magic-tech restraints, leaving her looking quite thoroughly secured.

(link:&quot;Well, at least the gag doesn&#39;t stop me from talking to people outside the fourth wall.  I must say, I always knew that in some timelines I actually lose, I just never expect it to be *this* one, you know?  Oh well.  Enjoy your prize.

Your wife walks over and gingerly pokes the captive on the nose.

“So… she’s really completely helpless?”

“Yup!”

Revissa seems unconvinced, and glances back at the case the restraints were pulled from.  “But… it looks like you forgot a few pieces.”

Ros’eela shakes her head.  “Nope, not at all.  We just haven’t gotten to the best part yeah.”  She walks over and pulls out the restraints one by one, handing them to Revissa.  “These ones are for me.”

“For you?”

“Yeah.  The power crystals only have enough energy to maintain the enchantments for a couple of days or so, max.  Probably even less for someone as powerful as her.  To well and truly seal her in, the device needs a ‘volunteer’ to provide perpetual bondage energy to keep it charged.”

“You mean… you’re going to lock yourself together with her… permanently?”

Ros’eela seems oddly excited by the prospect.  “Yup!  Well I mean… it’s not *permanent*.  Just really, *really* hard to remove.  I’m sure you’d be able to find a way to get it done, if you really wanted to.”

Revissa starts to protest, but Ros’eela holds up a hand.  “No need to try and talk me out of it.  This is… well, it’s something I think I have to do.  When you first came across me, you found me in the middle of training, remember?  For the past few years I’ve been searching for meaning in my life, and through re-connecting with my roots as a Knottie through bondage, I think I’ve found it.  This might be what I was born to do, to give up my freedom to seal away hers.”

As they talk, the fae woman tests the bonds, wiggling and squirming every which way.  But the look on her face seems to confirm that they are, in fact, fully effective at holding her.  If she wasn’t so distracted by the stimulator, an expression of fear might even have crossed her face.

“So don’t try to stop me.  Just help lock me in… and I guess keep the two of us in a storage crate somewhere on your ship.  But promise to play with us every once in a while, okay?”

For your own part, you kind of wish you had something to contribute to this scene, but you’ve been webbed up the entire time.  So all you can do is watch as Revissa eventually accedes to Ros’eela’s demand.  With the Knottie’s guidance, she snaps the iron bands around her body, even going so far as to fasten restraints around her head tendrils, snuggly anchoring them behind her back.  Straps connect their faces together, causing them to share the ball-gag as their lips lock into a perpetual kiss.  Once last click activates the stimulator on Ros’eela’s half of the device, sending her off into a pleasant hum of helpless enjoyment.

And just like that, it seems your fae problem has been dealt with, once and for all.]

|drink1)[(link:&quot;As Bad Ends go, this one isn&#39;t really the worst.  Quite... *stimulating*, no?  Bah, fine, probably far from my best pun, but the fact that I&#39;m still aware enough to make a pun at all is quite impressive, given the fact that I am also being rocked by an admittedly amazing orgasm.

What was it Ros’eela called it?  Perpetual bondage energy?  Somehow, you can actually feel it.  It’s like the device is sending out psychic pulses that make your body thrum with a desire to join them in their restraints.  It affects you even more profoundly when Revissa finally gets around to peeling off your silken bindings, setting you free after hours of being so snugly and comfortably secured.  Some part of you wishes that she hadn’t freed you, that she’d kept you tied up forever and ever - or better yet, that she’d joined you.

But you push those thoughts aside.  You still have a mission to take care of – and an old friend to thank for her sacrifice.  

Ros’eela seems perfectly happy with the arrangement she’s subjected herself to, already moaning eagerly as the restraints work their magic and fully surrendering herself to the device’s ministrations.  You suppose that her pleasure is what gives it energy.  The fae woman, too, seems thoroughly defeated, even more so than when she was wrapped up.  Whenever you met her gaze while you were both bound in silk, she always seemed to have a playful gleam in her eyes.  Maybe she was taunting you to try and escape, since she knew doing that would free her as well.  But now all her whimsy is gone, and she’s just grunting and groaning like any helpless captive would do in this situation.  You’ve got to hand it to Knottie technology - it really does work.

Once you’ve had your fill watching the two of them writhe in pleasure, you and Revissa load them up into a storage crate and lock the lid shut.  Then you track down the data tablet that controls the outpost’s security droids and instruct them to pick up the box and deliver it to the landing site outside the forest, to be loaded up onto your ship the next time it lands.  The two of them will make for precious cargo indeed.

Which is when you remember that they are not the only trophies available to you after this excursion.  After all, you know that Tula is probably out there in the forest somewhere, hard as a rock.  And you see no reason not to track her down and claim her for your collection.  With these drones, it should be easy enough to pick her up.

Ros’eela managed to track it and the rest of your gear down based on Revissa’s description of where you were captured, retrieving it by sending out some of the security drones that had been protecting the base.

As a parting gift, she entrusts you codes to operate the drones yourself, in case you have some need of them.  And, in fact, you think that you do.  After all, you have reason to believe that a statue of Tula is standing somewhere out there in the forest - and you see no reason not to track it down as a trophy of your time here on the planet.

And so you dispatch the drones from the outpost, giving them the general coordinates of where you encountered the basilisk.  To your delight, they return a short time later with the proof that your deception worked against the lusty spider.

From the way she’s posed, it doesn’t appear like she was taken by surprise.  There’s an eager expression on her face, as if she had just spotted a tantalizing target and was ready to pounce.  It looks like she really was expecting a brave Usami warrior instead of a basilisk, and paid the price for it dearly.  As is often the case with petrifications, her clothing has flaked away from her body, likely because it became frail and brittle after the transformation.  This gives you an unimpeded view of her naked form, allows you to run a finger over her calcified inner thigh, to tweak the stone nubs of her nipples, to feel the sharp point of her deadly back legs, now rendered as inert as the rest of her.

“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were turned on by this,” Revissa remarks quietly.  “I didn’t peg you for the kind of person to keep a statue gallery.”

You step away from the granite spider sculpture in embarrassment.  “What?  No… I’m not like that.  It’s just… nice to be able to appreciate her body without her immediately wrapping me up.”

“I thought you *liked* being wrapped up.”

“Oh I do.  But I also like beautiful women.  Either way, it’s not like I’m gonna keep her this way forever.  We’ll restore her once the mission is completed, and then we can turn her over to the proper authorities.”(if: $merrystone is true)[

Though come to think of it, Tula’s not the only spider who should be arrested, is she?  After all, you bumped into several more of them on the way here, and they, too, got turned to stone.  It’s only fair for them to stick together.  With that in mind, you increase the search radius of the drones, and tell them to bring in any more spider-shaped rocks they might encounter.

“Sure you will,” she says jokingly.  “But for now, can we get the heck out of here?  I never thought I’d say this, but I think I’m tired of being in a forest for so long.”

That gives you both a laugh.  And so, together you make the easy trip back to the entrance of the forest, your stone spider trophy hauled behind you by the drones.

Tula had been in charge before, but Zauzyne manages to convince the rest of her people that she was weak and incompetent for letting you escape, and thus deserves whatever fate that befell her.  She shows a similar callousness towards her own sister.  It seems that their culture is heavily based on survival of the fittest rules, and so since both of them have been proven unfit, there’s no interest in trying to enact a rescue.

You, Revissa, and Merry remain her personal property, kept enmeshed in silk in her quarters.  Apparently Tula had instituted a policy of ‘communal property’ during her reign, where captured slaves were to be shared among all the residents, but Zauzyne tosses that right out, happy to keep you all for herself on a permanent basis.  And since the silk that binds you is infused with the planet’s Ghost Matter, there’s no need for maintenance on your cocooned bodies, ensuring she can completely ignore the three of you whenever she doesn’t need you to slake her lust.

This new arrangement continues for several weeks.  During that time, Zauzyne seems heavily fixated on showing off her strength, of proving that she deserves to lead.  This eventually culminates in her organizing a full-scale assault on the Knottie camp near the ruins in an effort to gain more slaves for herself and her followers.  She leaves one night after firing up her troops — and never returns.  You’ll never know exactly what happened, but suffice to say, you can only guess that she wasn’t nearly as good of a leader as she thought she was, and now it is she and her kin who are the slaves.

Not that does you and Revissa any good, because you’re still wrapped up in the depths of a sprawling cave system, trapped in silk that will stay firm and fresh indefinitely.  You have no idea what happened to the rest of your crew - maybe they also were caught by one of the other perils on the planet, or maybe they tried their best to find you but eventually were forced to give up.  Sadly, that means you’re condemned to solitude, locked away and forgotten, never to see the outside world again.

Now it’s all of them who will be the slaves.

Sadly, the Knotties also released some kind of electro-static net over the orchard the spider-women were cultivating in retaliation for their assault, and the data collection device you’d planted there was destroyed in the process.  Without it, the mission is a failure, and you’re forced to return to your ship and leave the planet empty-handed.  However, there is one silver lining to it all.  After being set free, Merry repents for her actions, finally understanding what it feels like to be a helpless silk-bound slave.  You forgive her easily, and even let her join your crew.  For many years she’ll share in your adventures, both in the galaxy and in the bedroom, though it will take a bit of learning before she finally understands the meaning of consent.

This is another familiar spider.  Zauzyne’s sister, who attacked you the first time you passed through the cliffs area.  You lured her to the center of the forest where she was overwhelmed by the psychic predator and lulled to sleep.  But it seems sometime after that, she was fully petrified.  Were the bunny and the basilisk working together in some capacity?  You suppose it’s possible.  You wonder if she’s still conscious in there thanks to that, perhaps trapped in the dreams forced on her before she passed out.  There’s no way to know without the proper equipment, which is all the more reason to bring her and the others back to the ship.

“Good point.  Which spider-babe would *you* most prefer to be wrapped up and fondled by?”

It’s a relatively uneventful trip, illuminated by the bright aurora overhead, shimmering in the sky beneath the rays of the planet’s sun.

Looking up at the colors, something strikes you as odd.  The sun was high in the sky when you first landed, and it remains so even now.  Has a full day passed since you arrived?  Maybe so, but now that you think of it, you don’t recall seeing any change in the illumination of the sky at all so far.  Is the planet locked in perpetual daylight?

Curious, you open a comm channel to Vhaja back on the ship.  After reporting your success with the first data device, you pose the question about the sun.

“How fascinating,” she remarks, after spending a moment to refer to her environmental readouts.  “According to my own instruments, it should be the dead of night for you right now.”

Fascinating indeed.  “Well, the planet didn’t seem to get the memo,” you say dryly.

You hear Jyumon chime in from over Vhaja’s shoulder.  “This is just a guess… but maybe since it’s a ghost planet, every region is somehow spiritually locked into the time of day it was when the world was first destroyed.  In the same way ghosts of people always tend to be wearing the same outfit they had on when they died, maybe the sky itself is trapped in the same colors as it was in the moment the planet experienced its apocalypse.”

“Huh,” is all you can manage to reply with.  “Neat.”

“This development only makes this mission all the more important,” Vhaja says sternly.  “Please continue to the next two sites and plant the data devices.  Once we have all three, we can triangulate readings and perhaps come up with an answer to this mystery.”

Fair enough.  Before long you arrive back to where you landed, and take some time to rest, check up on your gear, and consult your map one last time to assure yourself where you want to head next.  And once that’s settled, you head out for the next leg of your adventure.

Revissa’s spell did what it was meant to do, meaning that the petrified body of the masturbating fae was delivered to the landing site by some helpful animal companions.

The gorgeous fae woman remains defeated after your clever ploy back in her curio shop.  She’s been shrunken down and imprisoned inside a snow globe, her body restrained by powerful iron bands that prevent her from moving.  And whenever you pick up the semi-sphere and give it a shake, her body jostles in all the right ways as snowy dust cascades around her helpless form.]

In terms of appearance, she looks like the half-fae princess Skadi, an associate of yours from some time ago.  Yet… somehow, you get the sense that this isn’t her.  It’s someone else entirely, just pulling that image out from your mind.

“Hey there!” she says brightly, walking in like she owns the place.  As your crew writhes in their silken bindings, she takes a moment to stroke and caress each woman in the room, savoring their grunts and moans.  “Looks like you’ve gotten into a bit of trouble, doesn’t it?”

Everyone looks towards her in confusion.  Who the hell is this lady, and how the heck did she even get on board the ship?

“Now, you may be wondering, ‘how the heck did I get on board the ship’?  The answer to that is – don’t worry about it.  You may also be wondering, ‘who the hell is this lady?’  Well, that’s a bit complicated, and kind of why I am here.  Somewhere, sometime, in some other reality, some or all of you may bump into me, and ask the same question - what’s this lady’s name?  And some folks at home might only be reading this right now because they were wondering the same thing.”

All of this talk is going over your head.  Is she going to help you or not?

“You might also be wondering - am I going to help you or not?  Well, that depends on your definition of help.  But I will say this, so pay attention, everyone - especially those of you reading along in front of a screen.  The letter of the day is “I”.  As in, “I” can do whatever “I” want; and “I” have decided to send your ship careening out into deep space, far, far away from any people or civilizations.  Of course, that means that “I” am probably dooming you all to a Bad End scenario, but also “I” don’t really care.  Though in my infinite generosity, “I” will make sure that your life support never runs out, and that you’ll stay hale and hearty indefinitely as you drift aimlessly through the cosmos… forever.  Got that?”

Everyone in the room gives a chorus of panicked, but muffled, objections.

“Right, so the thing is, “I” don’t really care.  Enjoy the rest of your lives, girls!”

And then she blows a kiss and vanishes, leaving you to your struggles.  Immediately after, an alarm sounds throughout the ship, and the computer system’s voice helpfully announces that your navigation systems have been completely overwhelmed due to your galactic position suddenly changing without warning.

Over the following hundreds and hundreds of years, you and your crew will have plenty of time to wonder just who that lady was.  After all, her words prove to be true.  Years and years go by, but no one ever finds you, and none of you ever manage to wiggle free.  You’re all doomed to struggle and squirm together as your ship drifts endlessly through the darkest depths of the cosmos, never to encounter any living being again.

It’s nearly overwhelming, seeing her amazing figure openly on display like this.

“Alright then, little woflie.  Say the word, and I’m yours.”

You almost do, right then and there.  But then you remember that your wife is still trapped as a riding horse from your race earlier.

“Before I say it… you need to turn Revissa back to normal first.”

The woman who is possibly named Mira pouts.  “Oh, poo, I was hoping you’d forget.”

“Do it!” you demand.

An impish smile crosses her lips. “You’re sure?”

For a brief moment, you’re gripped by a pang of anxiety.  Are you somehow making the wrong choice?  Is this another trick?  Were you supposed to say something else, some magic words that would actually get her to do what you want?  But you bite your doubts down.  No one ever survived an encounter with a fae by being indecisive.

“Yes, I’m sure.  Return Revissa to normal.”

“Ugh, fine.  Maybe you’re not as fun as I thought.”

She snaps her fingers, and the tiny merry-go-round in your hand starts to spin, whirling faster and faster until one of the ‘horses’ shoots out and smashes into you.  And when you look up, Revissa is laying on top of you, hale and hearty.  You throw your arms around her and hold her tight.  What follows is a kiss more passionate than anything in recent memory.

“I told you… never trust a fae,” she says when you finally come up for air.

“I could sue you for discrimination, you know,” says the woman, poking her face between the two of you.

Revissa bats her away.

“Anyway, if that’s all,” the woman says, “then I’ll just be going–”

“No!” you shout, cutting her off.  “I still won the game.  Which means I get to keep you!”

There’s a long pause, before Mira throws up her hands in surrender.  

“Alright, alright.  You win.  But how, exactly, would you like to keep me?”

Now that is certainly an interesting question.  Perhaps you could tie her up?  Oh, or she’d look lovely transformed into a statue…

Revissa taps you on the shoulder.  “Now hold on.  Even if it seems like you’ve got her, I wouldn’t trust this.  It could still be a trap.  She wouldn’t have put herself in this position if she actually thought she could lose.”

That makes sense.  But on the other hand… the prospect of keeping her as a trophy sure is tempting.  Besides, how could she have suspected you’d have guessed her name correctly?  As far as you can tell, it was pure dumb luck.  The name “Mira” simply popped in your head out of nowhere.  So it should be fine to make whatever demand you want… right?

You see, your actions are currently being dictated by someone outside of time and space, like a puppet that dances for their entertainment.  And well, since those folks asked to be entertained, I am only too kind to provide.”

She snaps her fingers, and to your horror, you see Lucinda’s skin start to grow even more gray than it was before as a stony texture washes over her supple skin.

And your cute little bug here will show up in my special gallery.  You readers at home can find it from the main gallery menu.”  She pauses a moment, and then smiles.  “Speaking of galleries… you still got the answer wrong, you know…”

|drink1)[

The sound of footsteps slapping against soft sand.  The texture of the air, hot and humid, as she made a dash towards cover.  The smell of the ocean, mixed with her own sweat as she pressed herself to her limits.  And, of course, the brief glimpse of her opponent from a stolen glance over her shoulder, not looking the least bit concerned.

Melfy didn’t know where she was, exactly.  It looked like a tranquil beach on some alien planet she had never visited, the sand colored a dark purple, the sky an ominous orange.  Nor was she sure how she’d gotten here.  The last thing she remembered, she was pursuing Sharda through the back alleys of some dingy market on a no-name moon.  They’d crashed through the door of a shop, the merchant had looked up in annoyance, and then – she woke up here.   Sharda was next to her, splayed out on the sand, recovering from the same dizzy spell.  That’s when the voice spoke to them.

“I sense bad blood between the two of you,” the voice said.  “So allow me to help you settle it.  The nature of this conceptual space is simple - two women enter, only one leaves.  Defeat your opponent to return to reality.  Escape is otherwise impossible.”

Okay, fair enough.  Melfy had wound up in stranger situations than this.  But there was one problem - she’d showed up wearing nothing but some underwear scraps - no sword, no blaster, no armor - nothing.  And though she might have had the advantage on Sharda in raw power, the Tsunojian was an adept at ice magic, which didn’t require any special tools.  As usual, the fight was rigged against Melfy from the start.  Though the fact that Melfy offered her old enemy a handshake once they both stood up didn’t help things either.  Her proposal was that they work together to try to figure out a way to escape without playing the mysterious voice’s game.  Sharda responded by blowing a gust of sub-zero wind at her that nearly froze her to the core.

So much for cooperation.  Shivering and disoriented, Melfy had made the logical choice to get the hell out there to find someplace to hide and regroup.  And so now here she was, running across the beach towards the rocky cliffs in the distance.  

Thankfully, her athletic advantage proved to be enough to outdistance the wily Tsunojian.  Other than a few lazy ice needles flung in her direction, Sharda didn’t even try to stop her.  That cool indifference of hers was always the worst part.  She’d betrayed Melfy’s old crew years ago with that same dispassionate expression on her face, as if selling out your comrades was the most mundane thing in the world.   Melfy could forgive a lot of things, but never that.  Which is why she couldn’t let herself be caught here.  If the parameters the voice spelled out really were true, than it would seem she’d have to take Sharda down, one way or another.

A few hours later, she was feeling better.  Sharda was nowhere in sight, but Melfy wasn’t worried.  From her vantage point high on the cliffs, she could get a good look at her surroundings, and figured the island they were stranded on was pretty small.  She’d find Sharda eventually - and the next time, she’d come in swinging.  All she’d have to do is close the distance fast, get the drop on her, deliver a few haymakers at close quarters before she had the time to get off any spells.  Then it would all be over.

The thought of clocking Sharda right in her smugly disinterested face was oddly relaxing.  A short rest had shaken the chill from her bones by now, so Melfy was really starting to feel the heat of this desert island.  Not to mention she was still sticky with sweat after all that running.  Above her she noticed the gentle trickle of a waterfall flowing from the rock face behind her, so she decided to take a quick shower to refresh herself before she went on the offensive.

It would be the last mistake she ever made.

She closed her eyes as the water washed over her and exhaled slowly, trying to relax the tension in her muscles.  The splashing sound the falls made as the water crashed against the stone beneath her feet was soothing, lulling her into a placid calm.  That’s why she didn’t notice the crackle.  At least, not until it was too late.  By the time the chill reached her, she only had time to open her eyes wide and form her mouth into a surprised “O” shape.  And then the slick water over her skin froze solid, sealing her in completely.

Through the disorienting chill, Melfy could barely make out the sound of Sharda’s voice from only inches away.  

“Gotcha,” she said lazily.  And then the air shimmered, and Sharda was in front of her.

*What?  How?!”* Melfy thought helplessly, her body totally rooted in place from the icy shell that covered it.

Sharda smiled, perhaps predicting her confusion.  “What, you didn’t think I’d picked up some new tricks in the years since you saw me?  Ice crystals in the air can bend the light… make me invisible,” she explained, as she languidly began snapping away Melfy’s frozen underwear, revealing the full extent of her frozen flesh beneath it.

Damnit!  So she’d been following Melfy the entire time, just waiting for her to let down her guard.  And she’d done it in the worst possible place, beneath a waterfall.  Now she was encased in ice and completely, utterly helpless.  Sharda had won.  

The Tsunojian glanced up towards the sky.  “So… this it?  Do I get to leave now?”

“You must finish her… permanently,” spoke the voice from up high.

Sharda paused for only a moment, before giving a lazy shrug.  “Alright then.”

There was no sympathy in her eyes as she walked up to the inert wolf woman.  No affection in her motions as she leaned forward to press her lips against Melfy’s wide-open mouth.  And no mercy as she breathed out a blast of wintry magic that flowed down the kemomi’s throat, that spread to every corner of her body, freezing her both inside and out.  The magical spell worked quickly, not just freezing her victim but transforming her, completely converting her into a statue carved from solid ice.  Melfy’s vision went dark and her mind went blank as she became a person no more, but an eternal sculpture of frost.

“That better?” Sharda asked.

“Yes, that will do,” was all the voice said.

And then the Tsunojian, and the statue she created, were back in the shop they had crashed through earlier.  The merchant they had disturbed flicked her wrist, ending whatever magic she had used to entrap the pair.  And then, with another motion, transferred the frozen wolf onto a small flat platform in a corner.  The device began to hum, scanning the makeup of the statue and generating an energy field that would keep it in indefinite stasis.  There would be no melting for the newest addition to her wares.  Sharda raised an eyebrow, then looked around the rest of the shop.  There were a dozen more inanimate women made from all sorts of other materials on display as well.

“With this added to my inventory, consider the damage you did to my storefront repaid,” the merchant said, striking a match against Melfy’s frozen cheek and using it to light a long pipe she pulled from a pocket.  

Sharda took one last look at the room, at the statues, and at her former comrade, rendered eternally frozen by her magic.  And then she shrugged.

“Alright,” she said, with her trademark disinterest.

And then she turned and left.

You clicked what you liked best, and it’s Skadi.  Yes, Skadi, as in, the woman who actually looks like that, and not me.  As a reward to you, why don’t we take a look at what might have happened to the seductive half-fae woman, in another place, and another time…&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

|drink1)[

Skadi smoothed out her dress, then created a small mirror out of ice in her hand to check her hair one last time.  Everything about her seemed in order.  Amazing figure, long, lustrous black hair, flawless pale skin, and a dark blue dress that wasn’t egregiously risque but nonetheless hugged her curves in all the right places.  Yes, she looked *good*.  Which was going to be important for this little get-together.

For most of her life, Skadi had thought she was merely an elf.  Long ears, long life, proficiency with magic, all the signs of being one of the fair folk.  And, to be fair, she was half-right, but *only* half.  Because while her mother was indeed her mother, it turned out her mother’s spouse was not her other parent.  Instead, she was born from a tryst with none other than the Winter Queen of the faeries herself, Lady Aconite.  Her mother had never told her about her true heritage; Skadi had only discovered it when she found herself in possession of a natural wellspring of magic that eclipsed anything she could learn through study.  And ever since she’d found out, she had been searching the realms for a way to get in touch with the other half of her heritage.

Her quest did eventually bring her in contact with members of the Winter Court, though so far she had not managed to gain an audience with the Queen herself – with her mother.  But all that was going to change.  She’d talked her way into becoming an envoy of the Winter Court, and in that capacity, she was now here on a diplomatic visit to the Lady Hzzzantha, Maiden of the Hive.  If she performed well, perhaps she would finally get the recognition she deserved.

And so she walked into the hive, flanked by a small retinue of Hzzzantha’s elite drones.  Her hostess tonight was a fairy who assumed the appearance of a beautiful queen bee, dressed in yellow and black, with gossamer-thin insect wings and a wicked stinger beneath her elegant gown.  She had a reputation for both efficiency and cruelty, though also a well-known fondness for ‘pollinating’ attractive women.  Skadi assumed it was for this reason that she was chosen as the envoy - perhaps she was Hzzzantha’s type.  Despite the fact that it seemed that was all the court saw in her, she was going to prove she had the talent to perform actual diplomacy - even if negotiations were taking place in a queen bee’s bedchambers.

Before long, the drones brought her to the deepest part of the hive, where Hzzzantha herself made her court.  The fairy was as beautiful as had been rumored, and from the smile on her face as Skadi stepped in, it would seem the attraction was mutual.

“Ah, a pleazzzzzure to make your acquaintance,” said Lady Hzzzantha, sitting imperiously on a throne made of honeycomb.

“The pleasure is all mine,” Skadi said with a low bow.

“Yes, it seemzzzz that the Winter Court still remembers the debt it owezzzzz me from the Daffodil Wars.  I will send word to them immediately that their tribute is accepted.”

Skadi blinked in confusion.  “Tribute?  I am afraid I don’t understand.  I am here for negotiations…”

The queen bee laughed.  “Oh, how delightful.  And the tribute doezzzzzn’t even know.  That makes it all the more sweet.”

She raised a hand imperiously, giving a silent order to the drones that were flanking Skadi on every side.  They buzzed in acknowledgement and roughly grabbed Skadi by the arms, forcing her to her knees.  One of them used the tip of its spear to run a long tear down the length of the half-fae’s dress, then pulled the garments away completely, leaving her naked and exposed in the center of the room.

“I – what?  What is this?  Surely you must understand you are attacking an envoy of the Winter Court?” Skadi yelled.  She tried to stand up, but the drones were powerfully built.

“No, my dear.  Like I said, you are not envoy, but tribute.  You see, it izzzz soon time for me to begin producing the Royal Jelly, but to do so, I need to mix my essenczzzz with another.  The pleasure the tribute feels will seep into the jelly, giving it its distinctive flavor.”

The queen bee rose from her throne, buzzing over on her beautiful wings, hovering an inch above the ground.  She reached down and cupped Skadi’s chin, bringing her head up so that she could meet her lips with a warm, yet dispassionate kiss.  As their lips pressed together, Skadi could feel a sweet honey begin to seep down her through, with a flavor deeper and more intoxicating than anything she had ever tasted before.  Her protests gave way to gurgles of pleasure as every nerve ending her body began to fill with an electrifying wave of stimulation that was almost too much to bear.

“There, now you are pollinated, my dear.”  She motioned to her guards.  “Bring her to her new chamberzzzz.”

Her drones buzzed in acknowledgement, then lifted Skadi up by the arms and carried her to a honey-comb like prison cell directly behind the throne.  They threw her in roughly, then moved aside, allowing Hzzzantha to dart up in front of her.  With a dainty pursing of her lips, she spat out more of her honey, gobs and gobs of it, enough to throw Skadi back and glue her to the wall of her cell.

The half-fae found herself unable to move as the honey quickly congealed.  She was completely encased, like a fly in amber, incapable of doing anything at all but looking forward helplessly.  The queen bee gave her one last imperious glance then flew away, allowing her drones to seal off the entrance to her honeycomb cell, leaving her trapped and alone, with nothing to occupy her but the pleasure.

And it *was* pleasurable.  The sweet nectar flowing through her soon made her forget everything other than the orgasmic joy of being part of the hive.  Her fears and anxieties subsided, taking away even the shame and humiliation of knowing that the Winter Court she had so long been trying to join had given her away as tribute, as if she were of no use to them as anything other than a gift.  Before long she was nothing but a vessel for sexual release, her endless arousal serving to fortify the Royal Jelly for many years to come…

|drink1)[

The instructor frowned.

“Druid Trainee Revissa, I’m afraid you’re simply not getting it.  You’ve got the raw power to bend nature to your whims, but I’m afraid your mind is just not in the right place.  To truly commune with the natural world requires grace, patience, and subtlety, not just brute force…”

Revissa glowered at the trainer.  “Grace?  Subtlety?  We’re not going to be able to win the war like that.  Stop trying to hold me back!”

“No, Revissa, I’m not trying to hold you back.  I’m trying to prevent you from getting yourself hurt.  Now why don’t you sit down and we’ll let the next student try at–”

But Revissa wasn’t having it.  “No, you *are* holding me back.  And I’ll show it to you!”

She turned and pointed her staff at a nearby flower, channeling her mana to bombard it with an overabundance of life energy.

“Watch this!”

“Wait, don’t–”

But it was too late, Revissa’s spell was already in effect.  The other students looked on in amazement as what started as a simple flower bloom quickly began to grow, quadrupling in size and sprouting leafy arms and root-like legs, letting it rise up high from the ground.  It’s open petals, now almost like a ‘head’ turned to regard her curiously.

“See that?  I’ve given birth to new life!  With an army of these we would drive out the invaders in no time!” Revissa proclaimed.

But the flower did not seem to be pleased with the idea of involuntary conscription into military service.  It pointed its petals towards the druidic trainee and began to bombard her with gooey bubbles of fragrant nectar, light enough to float on the air, but thick enough to pop into sticky, adhesive bindings when they smacked against her body.

“Wha– huh?  Wait, why are you— mmmphh!”

Her voice was cut off as more of the sticky resin glued itself over her lips.]

All the other students could only watch on in horror as the flower spat out more and more bubbles, eventually covering Revissa head to toe in a thick, amber-like sheathe.  Beneath the translucent coating, they could see her clothing dissolve – and also that her eyes were rolling back in her head in delight.  Before long all her willpower seemed to drain away, until she just lay there, writhing in ecstasy.

The instructor just shook her head sadly.  “You see, girls?  This is what happens when you do not properly respect nature.  Revissa has angered the forest with her brashness, and this is the result.  To make amends, we will leave her here as an offering to appease the nature spirits that were offended by her actions.  Perhaps they will eventually let her go… or perhaps they won’t.  It is not our call to make.

And so, the lesson continued with one less student.  Though given how distracting Revissa’ moaning and wriggling body was, not much more was learned that day.  The instructor made sure to pick a different spot for her class the next day, leaving Revissa behind.  Whatever happened next to her, no one would ever know…]

The fae woman smirks.  “Well, if you demand it, I guess I have no choice.”

She snaps her fingers, and suddenly the world around you starts to spin.  You’re overcome by a rush of vertigo, your vision goes blurry, and the forest you’d been standing in begins to fade away.  It’s all you can manage not to fully lose your lunch.  When everything finally stops moving, you find that you are now standing indoors somehow.  The smell of the air suggests you’re underground, and the nearly layered bricks comprising the walls makes clear it’s not a naturally occurring cavern.  

“Where are we?!” Revissa yells, stepping towards the still-nude fae woman.

“In the basements of one of the buildings at the Knottie camp near the ruins,” Mira replies.  “In one of their many dungeon cells.”

She walks forward, swiveling her hips alluringly, before stopping in front of a box that you can see is full of ropes, shackles, gags, and other bondage-related implements.  

“Why did we need to come all the way here?” Revissa grumbles.  “We had plenty of ways to tie you up right where we were.”

Mira smirks.  “Because if I am giving myself over to you as a prize, I want to make sure we do it *right*.  And that means, tying me up in a way that actually keeps me trapped.  Sure, you could summon some silly little plant vines to wrap me up, but I could slip out of them as easily as I can slip you all out of your clothes.”

To illustrate her point, she snaps a finger, and both you and Revissa are suddenly stark naked.

“Now then,” she continues, totally ignoring Revissa’s annoyance (and your arousal), “are you going to tie me up, or aren’t you?  These ropes here are woven with fibers that can even restrain a fae, like me.  I have to hand it to them - the Knotties really know their stuff.”

“Gladly,” you say, though Revissa puts a hand on your shoulder to slow you down.

“Now wait just a second… this is all too easy.  There’s got to be a trick in this somewhere.”

Mira frowns.  “Aww, well, if you’d prefer, you can always back out.  If you walk out through that jail cell door, you’ll wind up back in the forest we just left.  If you did that, I guess I’ll just have to tie myself up all by my lonesome, and wiggle around helplessly without any strapping wolf women to molest me.”

She flutters her eyes alluringly at you, making your heart skip a beat.

But your wife doesn’t look fully convinced.  “Melfy, there’s no way she would just surrender to us like this if she wasn’t plotting something.  I really think we should just leave.”

“Or, maybe, that’s exactly what she *wants* us to do,” you say.  “She expects us to get cold feet and back out.  Her so-called portal back to the forest will actually just teleport us straight into some other deadly peril, and when we get caught in it her obligation to let herself be captured  will be lifted.  If that’s true, the only *correct* play is to tie her up now and have our way with her!”

Revissa sighs and throws up her hands.  “Fine, but don’t come crying to me if this gets us killed.”

Your wife does have a point.  Mira was a bit too quick to agree to this.  Maybe you *should* just leave.  But… then you’ll never get to claim your prize…

The fae woman smirks.  “Well, if you demand it, I guess I have no choice.”

She snaps her fingers, and suddenly the world around you starts to spin.  You’re overcome by a rush of vertigo, your vision goes blurry, and the forest you’d been standing in begins to fade away.  It’s all you can manage not to fully lose your lunch.  When everything finally stops moving, you find that you are now standing in a dank and dreary chamber.  

The staleness of the air makes you think you’re underground somewhere, and a cursory glance at the shapes of the walls suggests this might have been repurposed from a naturally occurring cave system.

“Where are we?!” Revissa yells, stepping towards the still-nude fae woman.

“Deep in the caverns area,” Mira replies.  “Nearby where some dragons decided to bury their wealth.”

She walks forward, swiveling her hips alluringly, before stopping in front of a small, flat stone tile. 

“Of course, since hoarded treasure is involved, there’s plenty of traps lurking about.  Like this one.”  She lifts a leg, her foot hovering an inch above the tile.  “This here is a variation on a classic trap commonly called a ‘cursed plate’.  The moment I make contact with it, I’ll be locked in place, and be doomed to slowly vitrify into a glossy sculpture.  Feel free to stand around and wait for that to happen.  Or, if you get bored, you can always duck out through that passageway, there.  If you do, it’ll take you right back to the forest where you left.”

You take a step towards her.  “What, you think I’m not petty enough to waste a few hours of my life to get a prize?  I’ll sit here all day if I have to.”

Mira just smiles.  “Go right ahead.”

And then she steps down on the cursed plate.  The instant her foot makes contact her body seizes up, and a pulse of magic emanates from the device powerful enough to make your fur stand on end.  And there she stands, still as a statue, a smile on her lips and her arms raised above her head seductively.

“So… now I guess we wait,” you say, finding a slab of stone to plop down on top of.

Revissa sighs.  “I’ve come across a trap like this one before.  I think it needed a full three hours to completely transform someone.”

“I’ve waited longer while on hold with the Department of Starship Registration,” you say.  “This is nothing.”

But your wife doesn’t look fully convinced.  “Melfy, there’s no way she would just subject herself to a trap like that if she wasn’t plotting something.  I really think we should just leave.”

“Or, maybe, that’s exactly what she *wants* us to do,” you say.  “She expects us to get cold feet and back out.  Her so-called portal back to the forest will actually just teleport us straight into some other deadly peril, and when we get caught in it her obligation to let herself petrify will be lifted.”

Revissa sighs and throws up her hands.  “Fine, but don’t come crying to me if this gets us killed.”

“I think… I’ll withhold claiming my prize until later,” you announce.

The fae woman frowns.  “Well… that’s boring.”

“Is it?” you counter.  “The way I see it, this makes it more exciting.  Now I have a free ticket I can cash in whenever I want!”

“Assuming I let you.  Perhaps I’ll just disappear now, and you’ll never see me again.”

You shake your head.  “No way.  I’m too much fun to mess with.  You won’t be able to resist showing up some other time to bother me.”

For the first time you can remember, Revissa actually gives a sympathetic glance towards the fae woman.  “You see what I put up with?  That confidence of hers is insufferable sometimes.”

“But also…” begins the fae woman.

*”Incredibly sexy”* the two agree in unison.  

Your head swells up so much with pride you’re at risk of floating away like a balloon.  “So… see you later?” you say to Mira.

She laughs and blows you a kiss.  “It’s a date.  I’ll catch you some other time, wolfie.  And remember - don’t always believe everything you see or hear!””

And then she vanishes in a puff of flower petals.  You turn towards your wife and shrug.  “Maybe she’s not as bad as we thought she was?”

That gets you a painful crack over the head with her staff.  “You’re right; she’s *worse*.  But not as bad as *you* are.”

“Hey, that’s high praise!  More annoying than a duplicitous arch-fae?  I’ll take it!”

Your wife simply groans as you turn your attention back to the task at hand.  You’re still in the middle of the forest, with a data gathering device that needs to be planted.

“How fun!” Mira declares.  “I’m sure you’ll make it very nice and tight for me.”

You can’t help but notice how eager she seems for this.  You’d love to believe that’s because you’re just so sexy and domineering and she really wants to be toyed with by you, but in truth there probably is some kind of ulterior motive at play here.  But even so, you’re not going to be denied!  You’ve already survived all of her other tricks and traps, so what’s one more?”

You take a full hour to get everything right.  While you might not be a bondage expert like Krysta is, you’re nothing if not persistent, so by the end you’re fairly confident that the fae woman won’t be going anywhere.  You’ve got her trussed up with some intricately woven knots, suspended in the air from a hook you found anchored in the ceiling.  The bindings are arranged such that it resembles a hog-tie, though her wrists and ankles aren’t fully touching.  But this is to allow a tiny bit of leeway for her limbs to stretch at the hempen restraints, ensuring that every time she tries to move the rope will dig in tightly against her crotch, providing some forceful stimulation that you hope will drive her crazy.

“Well, how’s that?” you ask.

“Mmmphhh….” Mira mumbles into her gag, a nice round ball-gag you found that seals her lips quite snugly.  You can’t be sure, but she almost seems impressed with your handiwork.

Speaking of hands… you’ve still got two of your own, and you see no reason why you shouldn’t keep putting them to use.  As you walk a circle around your captive, you poke and prod her wherever you like, feeling up her soft, supple skin, stealing lusty squeezes on her impressive bosom, made all the more prominent due to gravity and the pressure applied by your bindings.

“Yup, I think this just about does it,” you say, nodding in approval as you finish your inspection.  “And if these ropes really are all they’re supposed to be, then even your fae magic won’t be able to get you out of this.  What do you think, Revissa?  Will this hold her?”

You pause for a moment, waiting for your wife’s reply.  But she doesn’t say anything.  Come to think of it, she *has* been rather quiet since you got started.  Is she annoyed with you?  You’d been so preoccupied with having your fun, you’d neglected to pay her any mind!  

“Hey – you alright?” you finally say, wheeling around to see where she’s gotten to.

And that’s when you finally notice what had been going on in the room while you were distracted.  Because standing by the entrance to the dungeon are a half-dozen Knottie women, all of them decked out in leather prison warden outfits.  Revissa is there too, tightly bound up in ropes with a gag pressed between her lips, squirming uselessly against her restraints.  The expression in her eyes is not fear, but anger – anger directed at you for getting her into this mess.

“Oh, uh… hey there, ladies,” you say.  “We were just uh… dropping by to check out the facilities, but uh… we’d love to be getting on our way now, if that’s okay…”

The lead Knottie steps forward, nodding with some slight approval towards the trussed up fae.  “That’s not bad,” she says.  “I could have done better, of course - and in a quarter of the time.  But you’ve proven you’re at least halfway competent.”

You cover your fear with a wide grin, stepping forward to offer the woman a handshake.

“Well then, from one bondage aficionado to another, surely we can come to some kind of agreement?”

The woman smirks and accepts your handshake – but far more firmly than you expect.  Once she has her grip on you, she yanks you towards her, pulling you off your feet, then shoves you towards her waiting compatriots.  What happens next happens so fast, you can barely process it.  You throw a few punches and kicks, put up the best fight you can, given the circumstances, but they have the advantage both in numbers and in talent.  And so it only takes a few minutes before they’ve got you tied up just like Revissa.

After that, the two of you are lifted up and shoved into the box containing all the ropes you were using on Mira.  Your hands are taped up to prevent the use of your fingers, your legs are bent inwards, your arms forced behind your backs, and your bodies tightly bound up against one another, squishing your breasts together.  A single gag is used to link your lips together into a forced kiss, and some wired stimulator devices are slipped between your legs and turned on to the maximum setting.]

“You should really pay more attention to your partner,” the lead Knottie says, standing over your bound-up bodies as she prepares to close the lid on the box.  “Hopefully this will give you all the time you need for it.”

Before she slams it shut, you look up to find the fae woman still bound and suspended from the ceiling.  Well, at least it seems like she can’t get away either.  Was this her plan from the start?  To trick you into getting distracted so that you’d be caught too?  Maybe a draw was the best she could engineer, given you managed to guess her name.  There’s really no way to know as the lid is closed and you’re both dropped into total darkness.

“Fine, you’re right, this is probably a trap,” you say.

“Of course it is,” Revissa replied.  “What do I always tell you?”

“Never trust a fae, and never play their games,” you say in unison with her.

And so, though it pains you to do it, you head out through the passage she indicated.  But you can’t help but steal one last look at her before you do.  It really would be nice to wrap some ropes around that sexy body of hers.

“Aww, leaving so soon?” she says with a frown.  “Oh well, guess I’ll just have to tie myself up and wiggle around here all by my lonesome.  Helpless and vulnerable, just waiting for someone to come along and play with me.  But it won’t be you, I suppose.”

You’re really very tempted to turn back, especially when she pulls out a ballgag and starts sampling how it would look pressed between her lips, but Revissa grabs you by the tail and yanks you back through the door.

As soon as you step out through the passage, the air again swirls and shifts, and a moment later you are standing in the forest once more. 

“See?  No traps.  She didn’t expect us to walk away,” Revissa says.

“*I* didn’t expect us to walk away either,” you grumble.

 Maybe if you somehow find the location she’d brought you to later, she’ll still be waiting for you, bound up nice and tight, squirming against her ropes and eager to feel the touch of your hands on her skin.  It’s a pleasant thought, but it’s sadly one you’ll have to put aside for now.  Because regardless of how you feel about it, it would appear that the issue of the fae woman is handled for now, which means now it is time to get back to your mission.  When you check your map, you find that your current position is even closer to your destination than you were when you left.  A gift from the fae woman, perhaps?  It’s hard to tell.  If you move forward now, it’ll be a clear shot to your goal, but if you’re feeling suspicious, maybe it’s better to double back.

But she can’t make any noises other than muffled grunts and impassioned moans, helpless against the tight bindings and the whirring stimulator device still sending tantalizing sensations through both of your bodies.

The Knotties have absolutely no intention of releasing you, and given that all your bindings are made from Ghost Matter, they never have to.  You can stay here, trapped in this box with your wife, forever, and that appears to be exactly what their plan is.  You’ll never know what they do with the fae woman, and you’ll never know what happened to the rest of your crew.  Maybe they were caught in some other way while trying to find you, or maybe they were forced to leave the planet after a fruitless search.

Either way, it doesn’t much matter to you.  The crate containing the two of you is eventually brought to a massive storage facility, filled with hundreds upon hundreds of containers with women in them, bound up just like you are.  Bondage is a way of life for the Knotties, and these ones seem determined to ensure that as many people as possible follow that path.  And so, now bondage is *your* way of life.  You’ll stay here for the rest of your days, unable to escape, trapped in pleasure, and constantly thinking about how foolish it was for you to get yourself into this situation in the first place.

And if not for that Star Scout candy you swallowed at the start of your adventure, you might not have seen *anyone* again.  It’s several months before your crew is able to use the homing beacon to track you down, allowing them to intercept you and Revissa while your shipping crate was being transferred to a long-term storage facility on another planet.  Thankfully, that means you won’t be spending the rest of your life in captivity.  Though sadly, it also means you quite thoroughly failed your original mission.  Perhaps next time, you’ll think better about dealing with fae.

GAME OVER

[[Start over-&gt;A0X]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="537" name="FD08DA" tags="" position="3800,1650" size="100,100">“We’re staying,” you declare, folding your arms firmly across your chest.  “I won her game, and I’m owed a statue.”

Revissa groans, but agrees with your decision - if only because she knows how stubborn you can be when you pick a hill to die on.  “Fine, fine,” she grumbles, picking a spot against a wall to sit down against.

And so, you wait.  The time limit for the vitrification to complete is about three hours.  And as the minutes march onwards, you notice the spread of the transformation creeping up the fae woman’s body.  It starts from her feet, creating a sort of glossy sheen to her skin that preserves its pale color, but mutes its intensity beneath the lacquer-like seal.  You suspect if you were to run your finger along the affected area, it would feel cool and smooth, like varnished wood.  

“Mmmm…”

The thought of it is honestly exciting.  Such a powerful and dangerous woman, forever frozen, completely helpless, entirely at your mercy.  Not… that you’re into that kind of stuff.  But you can’t deny the appeal.  Of literally owning a trophy that was once a rival.  It almost makes you want to… touch yourself.

“You gotta admit… she looks really hot,” you say.  “That amazing body, that long, lustrous black hair, that flawless skin, white as snow…”

Revissa flicks you on the forehead.

“Have you forgotten already that her appearance changes depending on who is looking at her?  To me she looks like Un-Rama, the legendary Guardian Moth.  With hair the color of silk, beautiful iridescent wings, that toned and shapely body… mmm…”

Despite her earlier objections, your wife does seem as turned on by the sight of her as you are.  Enough so that you suspect it wouldn’t take much to convince her to join you in a little… fun…

“Well, we’ve still got a couple hours left,” you eventually say, as you reach down to unclasp your belt buckle.  Why don’t we… do something to pass the time?”

Revissa looks up at you curiously, watching you disrobe with interest.  And when you saunter over to Mira’s frozen body, she gets the idea.

“For once, I like where your head’s at,” she says with a grin.  

Before long, her clothes have fallen to the ground as well.  And then the two of you are standing at either side of the woman, running your fingers over her inanimate form.  From the hips down, she’s glossy and hard, skin as smooth as you imagined.  But above that, she’s still warm and soft, her skin pliable, her breasts receptive to your touch.  You begin to knead them greedily, savoring the way they keep frozen in whatever position you leave them in, the way her helpless eyes don’t even register the perversity you’re visiting upon her.  Though you’d like to imagine she’s enjoying it.

…which is what gives you your next idea.

“Hey… so, if I remember correctly, so long as you’re pulled off the plate before the time limit expires, you’ll eventually recover, right?”

Revissa regards you carefully.  “Well, yes.  But I thought we were going to make her into a trophy,” she says.

“Oh, we are.  Don’t you worry about that.  It’s not *her* who’s going to get removed from this thing.”

“What do you – “ but she doesn’t get to finish the thought before you make your move.  Aside from the one Mira was standing on, there’s two more of the conspicuous stone tiles standing nearby her.  With a grin, you take a step backwards and place your feet firmly on top of the ancient device, slipping your fingers between your lower lips and cupping one of your breasts between your hands.

“Wha – Melfy?!” Revissa says in shock.

But you’re no longer able to respond to her.  As soon as you come in contact with the cursed plate, you become rooted to the spot.  It’s an incredibly odd sensation, at once both numbing and stimulating.  Cursed magic rushes through your body, locking every limb in place, preventing you from making any conscious efforts to move.  No, more than that, you’re not even *breathing*, and your heart isn’t beating.  Yet you can still see, hear, and feel everything around you.

“Melfy… you’re playing a dangerous game,” Revissa says.

But also a sexy one, you know.  Because now here you are, totally trapped, offering up your body to your wife to do with as she pleases.  And despite her objections, the temptation to play with you is too much for her to resist.

“You’re an absolute idiot, you know,” Revissa says, walking up to your inert figure.  “But… a damn sexy idiot.”

And then she starts to enjoy herself.  Touching your tail, stroking your toned arms, feeling up your taut rump.  She doesn’t do much to change your pose, appreciating the lewdness of your display.

“Gods, why do I let you get me so worked up?” she asks, biting her lip as she takes you in from every angle.  “Ten minutes, okay?  That’s all.  Then I am pulling you off.”

That’s fine by you.  After all, you don’t exactly have a say in the matter.  All you can do is passively thrum with pleasure as your wife uses your body as she sees fit.  So much so that neither of you even notice as the fae woman’s own transformation seems to reach its peak.

Her smile remains fixed on her glossy face, the light from her eyes dulled to a blank sheen.  If she’s still conscious in there, you don’t know it.  Though of course, you don’t know anything at all at this point, other than how turned on you are.  Revissa continues toying with you, every touch sending ripples of stimulation down your increasingly stiffening form.  And though you might not be able to express it, that enjoyment is contagious, leading to Revissa giving in to the desire to stroke her own body towards a warm climax.

“Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhh—” she moans, completely losing control of herself as she steps backwards then falls weakly to her knees.  The smile locked on her face belies the incredibly unfortunate results of that action – because she happened to land right on the *other* cursed plate.  Instantly, she seizes up as well, frozen in lust, entirely unable to help you, or herself, get out of the predicament you’ve thrown yourselves into…

Which leaves both of you nothing at all to do but to stew in your arousal and dwell on your poor judgment as three long hours go by more quickly than you might have liked.]

Having stepped on the plate first, your consciousness slips away before Revissa’s does.  All sensation leaves you, your nerve endings stop functioning, your vision goes dark, and your mind drifts into a pleasant, dreamy haze.  And then there is nothing, and you are no more than a statue.  A fate your wife shares with you only a few minutes later.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s that the fae woman seemed to have been serious about her commitment.  She, too, has been reduced to an inert, glossy sculpture, trapped in place for as long as the curse will hold.  Which, if the legends about these ancient relics are true, is certain to be a very, *very* long time indeed…

No one ever comes for them, and so they remain here, lost and forgotten, forever.

Your mind is forever trapped in that single moment of lust, the intensity of the pleasure magnified by the cursed magic of the ancient artifact.  Not that there is anyone around to know it.  Perhaps your friends fell victim to some other peril on this planet, or maybe they were forced to give up the search for you and left.  It doesn’t matter to you, because you’re just a statue now.

If you hadn’t swallowed that Star Scout candy at the start of your adventure, perhaps you would have stayed there forever.  But thanks to the homing beacon, your friends are eventually able to track you down, and extract the statues of you and Revissa from the caverns.  Unfortunately… restoring you both to flesh is another matter entirely.  The power of a cursed plate’s transformation is not to be underestimated, after all.

Your friends will search years and years for a way to bring you back.  But all those efforts are for naught, and eventually they lose possession of your glossy statues.  The two of you end up in auction houses and private galleries, shipped between collections of people who wish to possess statues of women such as yourselves.  Your chain of provenance continues over the centuries, moving from owner to owner, none of them ever interested in finding a way to save you.

It’s purely by chance that your glossy body happens to be on the site of a facility conducting highly experimental temporal research one day.  There’s an explosion, a loss of containment, and a massive time distortion, one which opens up a rift in the fabric of reality and sucks you both into it.  Terrifying, to be sure, but also a boon, since thanks to that you somehow get pulled through the ages and spat back out into the distant past.  On the bright side, the trip reverses your transformation.  Unfortunately, it also strands you in a different place and time, throwing you head-first into an entirely different adventure unrelated to this one.

The fae woman is nothing but a stone sculpture in her image, no longer able to torment you.  She remains frozen in a pose of lust, pleasuring herself with one hand while cupping one of her generous breasts with the other.  And though the spell that induced the arousal in her has long since passed, you can’t deny feeling a bit wet between the legs looking at her helpless body so brazenly bared before you.  Wet enough, in fact, that you can’t resist the urge to press up against her, to grind your hips against her stone legs.

“Oooohhh…” you moan, savoring the sensation of having this formerly powerful woman completely at your mercy.  It’s somewhat out of character for you to be so vengeful, but who can deny that you’ve earned it by this point?

Despite everything, you might have actually worked yourself to completion enjoying yourself like this.  But you don’t get the chance, because your perverse reverie is interrupted by the painful smack of a wooden staff on your head.

“My hero,” comes Revissa’s familiar voice.  You turn around to find her standing with an irritated scowl on her face, looking you over.  “And I was stupid enough to be worried about you.”

You rub your wounded noggin sheepishly.  “What happened?  You suddenly disappeared and then–”

“And then you decided to get frisky with a statue?”  Revissa yells.

It takes a few minutes to smooth things over with your wife before she gives her side of the story, though there’s not much to tell.  She’s not sure what happened to her after she was ‘disappeared’ by the fae, but she woke up slumped against a tree trunk around the same time that Mira got petrified.  At first she was worried something had happened to you, only to find that in fact you had decided to indulge yourself instead of searching for her.

“Would you believe I was still under the influence of her lust spell?” you ask.

“I think you were under the influence of your own libido,” she grumbles, giving you another whack with her staff, this time across your knees.

You wince and double over, but then look up at her hopefully.  “So… would this be a bad time to discuss how we might… take this statue home with us?”

“You realize that’s an utterly terrible idea, right?”

“Not any worse than any other terrible ideas I’ve had.  Besides, surely we should take it upon ourselves to ensure that a dangerous woman like this stays trapped and doesn’t cause any more trouble for the galaxy, right?”

Revissa sighs.  “Fine, fine.  Though only because we’re still technically on the run from spiders and I don’t have time to argue.”

She stamps the butt of her staff on the ground and takes a moment to cast a spell.  You can feel the swirl of nature magic flowing around her, but otherwise it doesn’t seem like anything’s changed.

“I’ve communed with the local wildlife,” she explains after she’s finished.  “They won’t show up right away, but eventually some animals will drag this hunk of stone back to the landing site.  Does that work for you?”

You tell her that it does.  Even when she’s angry with you, she still always comes through.  Though she’s right - the appearance of the fae was a distraction, but you’ve still got to get the heck out of here - there’s a sexy arachnid on your tail, after all.  At this point, you’ve already decided the cliffs are too dangerous.  You’re in the center of the forest right now, but surely if you keep going this way, the spider lady is eventually going to catch up.  So that just leaves one more viable route.

She strokes your tail lovingly, savoring the softness of your fur, before adhering Revissa to a nearby rafter.  Your wife thrashes and squirms valiantly, but all that accomplishes is prompting the spider lady to add more support tethers to her restraints.

“That’ll do.  This place doesn’t seem so bad.  And now we’ve even got some… entertainment.”  She cups your exposed breasts eagerly, eliciting a weak moan from your bound up lips.  Look, this might be a bad situation, but you can’t be blamed for enjoying it.  “But… I do think we could do with some more.  We’ve got a lot of horny girls back in the caves.”

After a moment of thought, she slices away the silk that was wound over your mouth.

“Oh, my name is Tula, but the way.  I’m your new owner, and you’re my new slave.”

You do your best to flash her a smile.  “Nice to meet you, I’m Me–”

“I don’t care what your name is, slave,” she says, cutting you off by pressing the pointed tip of one of her back legs against your cheek.  “But I have noticed that you seem fairly knowledgeable about this place.  So… maybe you know where I can find some more cuties for my collection?  Lead me to enough of them and maybe I’ll hang you up somewhere with a better view.”

Okay, this might be your chance.  Maybe you can use her desire for more slaves against her.  But is there anyone who you could tell her about that would be of any help?

]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="547" name="FE08ED" tags="" position="4750,3200" size="100,100">As the coin that depicts your wife flips through the air, several frustrated thoughts run through your head.  Why have you been letting this duplicitous fae dictate the terms of your engagements?  Especially now, that you’ve managed to guess her name and are owed a boon from her.  *You’ve* got the advantage here, not her, so why should you leave things to chance?

So instead of calling out heads or tails, you yell her name.  You’ll admit that you’re no expert on the magic of the fae, but almost every story you’ve read about that confirms that if you know their name, you hold power over them.  So maybe it’s time to use that power.

“What are you–” she begins to say, but gets cut off as the heavy metal coin you tossed in the air lands with a soft thud right between her breasts - which is exactly where you’d aimed it.

You grin.  “In the game of flipping a coin, the object is to toss it into the air, and then correctly call out where it will land, right?  Well, my guess was ‘Mira’.  And that’s right where it landed.”

There is a long pause as Mira wraps her mind around the exact wording of your attempt at trickery.  You’re sure if you gave her enough time, she’d figure a way to worm her way out of it.  Which is why you decide to act fast.

“So, since I’ve won, I get to propose a rule,” you say, loudly and forcefully enough to cut off her protest.  “And the rule I will make is that you and I are now both equally susceptible to any magical items you’ve got here in your shop.”

“Now hold on,” the fae says, “I haven’t accepted that you won the flip–”

“No, I won,” you snarl.  “And I’m not letting you distract or misdirect me any more.”

As you speak, your eyes dart around the room, taking in all the various knick-knacks on display here.  Most of them contain the frozen or bound bodies of women inside of them in some capacity, but one, you notice, seems currently vacant.  It’s a small glass half-sphere mounted on a base with a depiction of a cheery-looking building inside of it, and some powdery white dust spread out on the ground.  A snow globe.  

“Yes, well, even if you won, I’m sure there are better things you could propose then–”

But you cut her off again.  “And now, as my reward for guessing your name, *Mira*.”  The sound of her name being called out again makes her stiffen, her eyes drawn towards you as you continue to speak.  “For my boon… I want you to swap places with this building here.”

You pick up the snow globe and hold it out for her.

“Well, I–”

“*Now*, Mira!”

The room reverberates from the strength of your voice, the confidence and authority that radiates from your words.  You’re through being bossed around by this woman.  So now, she’s going to be yours.  With forceful steps, you walk over, pluck the coin from between her breasts, and then thrust the snow globe in front of her face.

“Now.”  This time you say it with a grim quiet, speak with the firm belief that your words must be obeyed.

Mira’s face blanches, but she does finally manage a smile.

“This, my dear,” she says softly.  “*This* is why I take an interest in you.”

And then she snaps her fingers.  What happens next is a confusing blur of movement, a shifting of space and time, a rearranging of the very floor you are standing on.  It’s at this point that you realize the little building inside the snow globe might have actually been a depiction of the curio shop itself.  So… what would it mean if you asked her to move it?  That’s a level of meta complexity that goes far beyond your understanding, but… you’re pretty sure it’s going to play out poorly for Mira.

You honestly can’t even process what happens next.  You feel like you’re being pulled into a million pieces and crushed into a tiny ball, all at the same time.  But when it finally ends, you find yourself laying on soft grass, looking up at the sky above.  The strange shop is gone, but you feel the weight of something pressing down against the palm of your hand.

(link:&quot;A fittingly ironic punishment for me, given the form I&#39;m appearing in.  Altogether a rather embarrassing defeat, though one must expect such things to happen every now and then.  After all, if there was no chance of losing, than there would be no joy in savoring the sweetness of victory, either.&quot;)[(show:?drink1)]

Inside the glass sphere, Mira stands firmly restrained, metal clamps wrapped around her shapely body.  Those weren’t there before, you know, but perhaps the magnitude of the magic involved with trapping her manifested them somehow.  If you had to guess, they’re probably made of some kind of enchanted iron, which you are pretty sure fae are weak to.

“------”

She says something, looking out from her prison up at your body, which from her perspective must be gigantic.  But whatever it is she says, you can’t hear it.  So instead, you just hold the globe aloft and shake it vigorously, watching the powdered snow fly all about and her hair flip around wildly.  To be honest, you’d have preferred trapping her in a more lewd or embarrassing position, perhaps without her dress on, but in a way, the lack of eroticism to her prison feels like it makes the magic stronger.  As if what’s been done to her is meant to be an ironic punishment rather than something to titillate. 

“Ooof.  What… happened?”

The voice comes from beside you, where you find Revissa sprawled out on the grass.  You just grin happily as you hold up your prize for her to inspect.

“You… you beat her?” she says in wonderment.

“I did.  And something tells me that I *really* beat her this time.”

Your wife nods, tapping on the glass in amusement.  Mira looks none too pleased.

“You’ll have to tell me all about how you managed that.”

“Of course!”

And so you do, in intimate detail - and with a tiny bit of embellishment.  This is a rare moment where you get to bask in a hard-earned win, so you’re not going to squander it by being humble.  And to add a cherry on top of your already stellar luck, it appears that the spot you were thrown to is only a short distance from the entrance to the forest!  Which means you don’t even have to worry about any spider-babes as you take a leisurely stroll away from the cover of the trees.
